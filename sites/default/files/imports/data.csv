COMMENTS:
I think good for Middle East; interesting for popcorn.  Others, wait and see.  The story is completely crazy – these sea creatures attack and attack and attack; and the script does an interesting job contrasting the slow descent into madness experienced by FRIEND with the crashing interruption of brutal fight after brutal fight.  How mad would you go if your life was threatened every night?  Interesting project, pending cast info. Director of 30 Days of Night.  It’s a weird project in terms of the fact that its not standard horror; not really arthouse, a bit in between.

SUMMARY:
INTRO –  1924. South Atlantic Ocean  - A Portuguese shipping vessel crashes on reefs by a small island. A mysterious man watches from a lighthouse as the sailors are devoured alive by something ominous in the depths. 

FRIEND, a naval weather officer, is ferried by vessel to the same, small, abandoned island.  He meets GUNNER, a huge, beast of a man who shows no hospitality at all, even after FRIEND explains that he is there to replace the previous weather officer, whom GUNNER explains died of Typhus.

His first night on the island, FRIEND stays in the small officer’s cabin, but his sleep is disrupted by the vicious attacks of mysterious, manlike, reptilian sea creatures.  Fighting with any means at his disposal (a log from the fire, a burning poker) he barely survives. 

He turns to GUNNER for help, hoping to stay the next night (the beasts attack only at night) inside GUNNER’s fortified Lighthouse, but GUNNER refuses him entry, opening fire at FRIEND.  

FRIEND eventually catches GUNNER outside, and gets the jump on him, holding GUNNER’s reptilian companian TOAD, hostage and forcing GUNNER to let him come into the lighthouse.  TOAD is one of the sea creatures, but she is a mysterious one, she keens nightly for her friends, is she beckoning them to attack?  FRIEND is shocked to find that TOAD and GUNNER are lovers;

GUNNER trains FRIEND in the ways of attacking and killing the sea creatures, and before long, the nerdy, bookish FRIEND becomes quite adept.  He also assimilates other behaviours of GUNNER’s, including, most troublingly; sleeping with TOAD as well.  

FRIEND and GUNNER find a stash of dynamite under the sunken remains of the Portuguese ship and wind up destroying hundreds of the sea creatures.  GUNNER goes mad during the attack and winds up getting killed. 

FRIEND seems to lose his mind as well, and by the time his replacement arrives on the island, he looks exactly the way GUNNER did when FRIEND himself arrived.

 A young arab boy struggles with racial prejudice and winds up assuming the identity of an Israeli friend. 

COMMENTS:
Script has a very rich setting, strongly written characters, particularly SA’ED and DARWISH, and is propelled by very real emotion and some moving subject matter.  Strong director and interesting project for the most part; however,  the script, for me, felt a bit lacking.  The structure is quite odd; ostensibly the story much less about SA’ED’s relationship with JONATHAN (that eventually leads to his revelation that he’d be better off as a jew than as an arab) than it is a memoir of SA’Eds that spends far more time on a seemingly whimsical riddle than on any other topic. The riddle, which felt very much like a small character building plot point that could have been as powerfully dealt with in a five or ten page sequence, devours nearly half of the film, while SA’ED’s enormously difficult time in the Israeli school, his love story with NAOMI, and his relationship with JONATHAN are squeezed into the remaining space.  Very poor structurally in my opinion.  Worth reading as it has a lot of merit in some regards, but perhaps another draft is the best place to start. 

SUMMARY:
SA’ED, a young arab man in his early 20s, uses the identity of JONATHAN FORSCHMIDT, an Israeli, in order to secure a spot in an exclusive medical school in Jerusalem.  The real Jonathan lies sick in a hospital bed, nearly dead. 

FLASHBACK – Ten years earlier, SAED lives in a small Arab town called TIRAH.  His father DARWISH enlists his help adjusting the antennae on their roof so they can watch Arabic TV but SA’ED falls off the roof and gets badly injured. 

The local TV studio advertises a contest;  the local school teacher JAMAL announces a riddle and challenges the villagers to solve it. JAMAL and DARWISH had been childhood friends and their rivalry continues to this day… “he couldn’t spell his own name until the ninth grade, the low life collaborator,” Darwish accuses. DARWISH had been a radical in his youth, and views JAMAL as a traitor. 

SAED’s grandmother KAMLA tells SAED that JAMAL had betrayed DARWISH to the government, snitching on him for being a protester, which led to Darwish getting kicked out of university and imprisoned, while JAMAL wound up being rewarded by being made a professor, despite his ignorance. 

Meanwhile, the village is stirring with people trying and failing to solve JAMAL’s riddle. At school, the children participate in a peace program that brings Jewish children to the town.  SAED brings one to his house, and the two play innocently until SAED gets the boy to translate a Hebrew newspaper article that mentions DARWISH.  The boy tells him that the article calls Darwish a terrorist.  The boy is terrified and leaves quickly, but SAED seems thrilled. “My dad is a terrorist!” 

DARWISH is selected by his radical political party to solve the riddle. They fear that JAMAL will use the credibility of the unsolved riddle for political gain, and are determined to thwart him, but the group is running out of time.  In mere days, JAMAL will reveal the answer to the riddle at a public ceremony. 

DARWISH is troubled and cannot crack the riddle.  Frustrated, and with time running out, he sends SAED to the store for cigarettes. SAED realizes the answer to the riddle is PARLIAMENT; a play on the cigarettes and the governmental body and rushes to tell his father. DARWISH manages to reveal the correct answer and embarrass JAMAL publicly.  DARWISH lauds his son; admitting it was SAED who cracked the riddle.  DARWISH is immensely proud. 

DARWIS H sends SAED to Jerusalem to attend a Hebrew school.  SAED doesn’t want to go, and DARWISH is heartbroken as well, but its such a good school that he demands SAED stay.  The first weeks are tremendously hard; SAED is homesick, he gets made fun of for his background and his accent, and SAED even tries to return home with all of his luggage, but eventually SAED starts to fit in.

SAED meets and befriends JONATHAN FORSCHMIDT, the sickly Israeli boy, and the two get along well, despite their cultural differences. 

PRESENT DAY – SAED gets a photo ID saying that he is JONATHAN. 

FLASHBACK  - SAED, 17, falls for a young Israeli girl NAOMI.  Saed has become more and more like his Israeli friends, but his background is never forgotten.  When a group of arab boys starts picking on Naomi, Sae’d is forced to side with his new jewish friends.  SAED and NAOMI share a brief romance that is interrupted by the GULF WAR; students are sent home when the scud missiles start detonating in the region. 

When SAED returns, he is forbidden from seeing NAOMI. She gets a new boyfriend and belittles her relationship with Saed.  “It was just a kiss and a half.”  SAED is heartbroken, and his pain boils over; at a school dance he attacks her new boyfriend and gets expelled.  

SAED returns home, disappearing from his friends in Jerusalem.  While he is gone, JONATHAN’s condition worsens.  Eventually, SAED returns and starts a new life but finds that as an adult, life as an arab in Jerusalem is nearly impossible.  He takes JONATHAN’s ID and gets a better job and gets into medical school.  Jonathan’s mother knows that SAED is doing it, and allows it; as if SAED is living JONATHAN’s life.  JONATHAN dies, and SAED assumes his identity, as if SAED was the one being buried.

COMMENTS:
A better than average popcorn script with some really interesting attachments as the director and lead. The script gets bogged down in the middle and I had a really hard time buying the Driver’s involvement with IRINA; especially when her husband returns… that aside,  the action sequences are really well written, cool, exciting, visceral; and also the criminal characters are portrayed in a really interesting manner; I was taken in by how loveable SHANNON, NINO and BERNIE wind up being portrayed; they’re not just stock criminal characters, there’s heart and depth to them.  The main characters are actually the weaker links, but I think GOSLING will be really cool, and can play an interesting bad ass, despite the fact that he’s not known for this type of thing.  I’d much rather see him in this role than Paul Walker or some generic lead.  Consider for popcorn. 
 
SUMMARY:
DRIVER is a world class driver;  with an uncanny ability to control a car; improvise under pressure and get out of incredibly tight situations.  He drives a getaway car for some armed robbers; nearly getting caught by police cruisers and a helicopter before pulling into a Staples Center parking lot just as a Clipper’s game gets out; Driver is in a WHITE HONDA CIVIC, the most popular car in L.A. and when the game lets out, its impossible for the cops to track him. 
 
DRIVER gets his cars supplied to him by SHANNON, an aging, infirm mechanic who loves Driver like a brother. Shannon dreams of getting out of the movie biz (he supplies cars for action movies, and Driver moonlights as a stunt driver) in order to open his own nascar racing team, with Driver taking the wheel of their stock car. 
 
SHANNON has a couple of investors interested in backing him; namely BERNIE ROSE and NINO; two gangsters. BERNIE is reluctant to join the venture, until he meets and is impressed by DRIVER.  “How much do you need to get started?” 
 
DRIVER meets a beautiful Latina women and starts spending a lot of time with her; IRINA has a child named BENICIO; and she’s also married, but her husband is in jail. DRIVER brings them to a movie studio & Shannon gives the excited kid a tour; and Driver also lets her watch him practice racing on the track.    The night she finds out her husband is getting out of jail, Irina gives Driver a long, bittersweet kiss. 
 
Irina’s husband STANDARD gets out of jail and reclaims his territory as head of the household. DRIVER lets out his anger on set; after SHANNON gets into an altercation with an AD, the driver explodes, nearly killing the guy. 
 
DRIVER sees Standard get beat up by thugs; Standard admits that he’s in debt to some criminals from the joint and that if he doesn’t make a big score they’re gonna come after Irina and Benicio. 

DRIVER reluctantly agrees to get in on Standard’s score; and Irina gets very suspicious that the men are planning a job; Standard is staying out late and spending a lot of time talking about how he’s gonna “take her away.” Irina begs driver to tell her if anything is going on, but Driver is forced to lie. 
 
The job goes badly; they rob the bank, but as Driver waits with the getaway car, Standard and another thief get killed.  Driver and a female accompliss speed away, but they get chased by a MUSTANG; which driver thinks has been tipped off.  The girl admits that the boss, COOK, was planning a double cross.  A hitman kills the girl and tries to kill the Driver, but he escapes. 
 
Driver goes on the lamb, hiding out with Shannon’s help; Irina is irate; her husband is dead and she blames Driver. 
 
Driver tries to return the 3 million dollars to the gangsters who set up the double cross, but finds out its NINO and BERNIE.  He tries to arrange a drop, but NINO orders a hit; NINO needs to eliminate him to cover his tracks – the 3 million was money he robbed from a fellow Mafioso, and he’s got to get rid of everyone involved.  Bernie, looking for Driver, kills Shannon.
 
Driver kills NINO.  Bernie seems to want to settle the situation, and meets Driver at a polish restaurant where the two enemies share a meal together before getting into a knife fight in the parking lot.  Driver takes a vicious injury but kills Bernie. 
 
Driver leaves the money for Irina and Benicio and starts his engine, to head into the great unknown.

A Latina spin on Jane Austen's 'Sense and Sensibility,' where two spoiled sisters who have been left penniless after their father's sudden death are forced to move in with their estranged aunt in East Los Angeles.
 
COMMENTS
Comedic adaptation of Jane Austen, it’s a bit of a clunker.  Characters are quite flat, silly, and feels very TVish.  The plot loosely adheres to the original, and the loves stories are trite and predictable.  It’s a chick flick, for younger audiences. Definitely not arthouse. 
 
SUMMARY
MARY, a 18, year old stuck up rich Latina girl and her older sister NORA, a dorky (but attractive) girl concerned with justice and the “important” things in the world head home for their father’s fiftieth birthday celebration. GABRIEL is a proud, doting father, frustrated by the fact that his daughters often fight. During his party, GABRIEL has a heart attack and dies. 
 
At the funeral, MARY and NORA are shocked to find out they have a 30 year old brother GABE, who is married to snooty OLIVIA.  At the reading of the will, they are further shocked to find out their father was broke.  They are going to have to sell the house to pay off his debt.  OLIVIA’s brother, the ruthless but sexy! Lawyer EDWARD arrives and seems charmed by NORA. 
 
MARY and NORA are offended by OLIVIA’s plans for renovation and are forced to move into their aunt AURELIA’s house in a crappy part of East LA.  MARY can hardly bring herself to get out of the car she is so upset and freaked out by her new, poor lifestyle. MARY is forced to sell her Mercedes and get a beat up Toyota, which a neighbor BRUNO helps her fix up.  
 
EDWARD arrives with a UHAUL truck full of all their stuff and even gets NORA a job at his law firm. MARY starts a romance with her rich literature professor, RODRIGO, but keeps having argumentative flirtations with her new neighbor BRUNO. Meanwhile, NORA uses her new job to help a group of Mexican workers via pro bono work. 
 
AURELIA throws a big party; MARY and RODRIGO have a great time, and BRUNO gets very jealous.  NORA and EDWARD kiss, but she tells him he’s in her way, in the way of her career and dreams, etc.  Embarrassed, he leaves.  Shortly thereafter, MARY and NORA get invited to his engagement party. NORA is shocked. 
 
NORA and MARY attend the party.  MARY is shocked to find that RODRIGO is there with his wife! To make matters worse, they have bought the Dominguez house, which OLIVIA has made look like a McMansion.  GABRIEL’s dream home is all but gone. In tears, MARY leaves, and winds up getting hit by a car. 
 
MARY is forced to ride around in a wheelchair because she has broken legs, and BRUNO makes a ramp for her to get into her house.  MARY apologizes to him for having been so cruel, and it’s clear the two have a romantic future.  
 
EDWARD arrives, tells NORA he canceled his engagement and asks NORA to marry him. The entire block breaks out in a party.

COMMENTS 
 I really enjoyed this script, BUT, full disclosure: I love british gangster pics; and this is like a cross between a brit gangster pic and Walter Hill’s the Warriors… something that they mention in the sales sheet, but having read it, I will attest that this is definitely in the same vein.   My enthusiasm aside, this is like a more violent version of Greene Street Hooligans; it’s not a standard, broad audience friendly action movie and will appeal more to genre heads than mainstream movie goers.  The plot veers into ludicrous, especially towards the end, but in terms of grit and action, its packed wall to wall.  Smarter than the average popcorn movie, but NOT for Lat Am (unless the cast and director are more mainstream), probably NOT for Indonesia… only would work in a place where action movies with heavy british accents would thrive.   Director and Cast are going to be essential; I imagined it in the vein of Bloody Sunday; but the choice of director would do a lot to help anticipate the style of the movie.  Good script; questionable commercial potential; wait and see until director and cast. 
 
SUMMARY 
JOE; a former soccer hooligan, has turned his life around by taking a job for a big corporation; his new lifestyle helps him pay for an elite private school for his young son, but Joe’s roots are never far from the surface.  When his boss TREVOR insists that join him at an All England Soccer match in order to woo an American client, (and sell him a crappy land deal) Joe is forced to drop everything, and also forced to abandon his principles and lie to the client.  On his way into the VIP suite, Joe is spotted by his former “firm” (a group of hooligans) called the REGIMENT. Their leader, RAY starts to incite a race riot during the England/ Turkey soccer match and the crowd starts boiling to a frenzy.  Meanwhile, a Turkish national gets killed and JOE, who happened to be in the bathroom, looks like the culprit, despite the fact that he was just trying to save the guys’ life.  JOE is forced to go on the run; and as the riot explodes, he has no place to turn but to run with his old boys… “you were the boy back in the day, but that was back in the day.” The authorities believe that Joe has returned to his life of crime. 
 
The firm is deep in enemy territory in Istanbul, and a huge, rival Turkish gang called the ULTRAASLANS are hunting for them.   Joe gets jumped and the other members of the Regiment quickly come to his defense; but the Ultra Aslans have an incredible numerical advantage.  Joe suggests the Regiment retreat to a train, where the small space will eliminate the numerical advantage.  The fight takes to the train and Joe starts beating the turks viciously; the hooligans call to him by his old fighting name, “grievous.” Joe realizes he has crossed back over the line into his old life. 
 
The Turkish police and Scotland yard are on Joe’s tail. They call his wife PENNY and tell her that Joe has murdered the Turkish Judge.  They put a tap on her phone. 
 
Joe and the hooligans hide out in a Four Seasons; but when Joe calls Penny, the tap goes to the police; and also to the Turkish Mafia who have an in with the force; the mafia dress like hotel waiters and burst in, brawling with the Regiment. The cops surround the place and fire rubber bullets at the hooligans. KARGAN, the crooked cop who killed the Turkish judge is there and Joe recognizes him. 
 
A female cop, SEDA, starts to think that Joe may be getting framed; he saves her life during a chase; he tells her that he remembers something the masked hitman said “gumus,” and she’s confused why the Turkish mafia would want to kill him. 
 
Kargan hires another Turkish gang; the MECHANICS to kill Joe. The Regiment hijack a boat and cross a river, heading towards Trevor’s private plane in a desperate attempt to get out of the city; but the mechanics attack as soon as they hit the shore. 
 
Another gang; the K2, also attack.  SEDA realizes that KARGAN is trying to kill JOE; “if you take him on, you better have some serious backup.” 
 
After fighting their way all through the city, Joe leads them to the private airstrip; but KARGAN and the other cops are already there.  The Regiment boys are screwed.  Joe wants to give up.  RAY calls him a quitter and blames him for abandoning the firm and ruining their cred and breaking their spirit when he quit years ago.  “We were your family!” 
 
SEDA gets to the bottom of the situation: she talks to the Attorney General; GUMUS was a mission to find out who from the police force was a turncoat for the Turkish mafia; KARGAN was the target and he killed the judge to protect his identity.  The AG tells SEDA to bring Joe in alive; as a witness. 
 
Joe, meanwhile, hatches one desperate, crazy plan: he gets ALL of the English Firms who came to town for the soccer match to team up and join them at the airport.  A huge riot is brewing, with Joe at the center. 
 
The Hooligans get the jump on the Turkish police, capture a few and don their uniforms in an ingenious ruse that helps them get past the enemy lines into the airport.  KARGAN catches JOE, RAY and the others just before they get onto the plane; He’s about to have his men kill Joe, but SEDA comes to the rescue, decking Kargan and getting JOE on record, fingering Kargan for the murder of the judge.   
 
JOE, RAY and the hooligans fly on the jet; Joe quits – calling Trevor a liar and telling the American investor that the British deal is bogus; The investor, EDDY, hires all of the hooligans to work for him in an unruly South American territory. “You have no idea what you’re getting into.”

A doctor rehabilitates an ultimately falls for an amnesia-stricken victim unaware that he is actually a serial killer.


NEW COMMENTS:
There’s a new director attached and some elements of the script are reworked,  but the major elements, and major flaws of the old script remain, namely, there’s a real lack of suspense, and the inherent flaw is still there: The audience KNOWS that Jack is the killer; only the characters in the script are in the dark, which is the reverse of the normal convention for a reason – it takes away the audience’s suspense! Rather than being a thriller this plays more like a  psychological drama, and it seems accidental.   Anderson can make  
good movies, (THE MACHINIST) but he’s not a sure thing; and this one is looking more and more like a pass to me: (there have been multiple drafts, it’s a project they’ve been batting around for several years now, and the drafts aren’t getting significantly better in my estimation. All bad signs.


OLD COMMENTS:
This director made a pair of good, mainstream thrillers in the early nineties; THE GOOD SON, and SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY; but its been quite a while since he’s made something strong, and this script could still do with another rewrite.  The pacing of the script is off; the first half unravels far too slowly, before the story picks up and gets exciting about 2/3 of the way through, but then wraps up everything too quickly at the end. Pacing issues aside, there is also a lack of suspense throughout most of the film, as the audience knows immediately that JACK is the killer, and it’s only the characters, rather than the audience, who are shrouded by mystery; (films tend to work better when the opposite is true, in my opinion).  Popcorn only, definitely broad and not a stylish enough thriller to draw euro audiences, it’s a wait and see at best.


The major difference I see so far is the elimination of one of the doctors, DR HENRY, which cuts out a love triangle that was in the earlier draft.


SUMMARY:
A KILLER attacks a woman outside of a 24 fitness; strangling her to death.  She is the fifth victim who has died under similar circumstances.  Detectives PETE and CHEEKS have been tracking the serial killer; and their superiors are getting frustrated with the lack of clues or progress in the case, but PETE insists that he is getting inside the killer’s mind.


After the most recent strangling, the killer crashes his car and gets taken into a trauma unit where a doctor saves his life; but when the killer wakes, he has completely lost his memory.


“Jack” as he becomes known, gets treated by a female doctor, MARIE, a specialist in memory; but the process is slow and frustrating. The situation is complicated further by the fact that Marie’s superior is also her former lover, DR. HENRY, and when he tries to get involved in treating Jack; Jack lashes out… sensing that Henry is an asshole.


Meanwhile, the cops get frustrated with the investigation and PETE gets kicked off the force after getting into an altercation with his superiour.  JACK and MARIE grow closer during the treatment, and she eventually hands his case over to a colleague and succumbs to her feelings; the two become lovers.


Despite no longer being a cop, PETE continues working the case, eventually finding a significant lead.  Comign to the realization that its likely something terrible happened to the killer; PETE finds Jack’s crashed car.


HENRY confronts JACK about his relationship with MARIE and the two get into a scuffle; JACK strangles HENRY to death and instantly his memories come flooding back; in a wave of nausea, Jack realizes that he’s a serial killer.


JACK tells Marie that he wants to discontinue their treatment and wants to start his life from scratch; he decides to get a new last name.  Henceforth onward he will be known as JACK NEWMAN.  Marie is touched.


Jack’s old life refuses to fade away that easily.  PETE shows up.   
PETE lies; says that he’s been hired by JACK’s sister, who is hoping to find her lost brother, and shows JACK a photo of DANA; one of Jack’s victims.  Jack feigns ignorance.


Jack starts to act more and more like his old self – and MARIE gets spooked when she sees him looking more fierce and dangerous.  JACK passionately grabs her and has sex with her; so forcefully that its borderline rape.


The new doctor on the case, DOCTOR SLOANE, detects brain activity and thinks she can tell that not only is Jack now faking his amnesia; he’s also quite possibly EVIL.  She warns MARIE and MARIE gets spooked when she finds hundreds of perverted photos of women on Jack’s computer.


PETE tells MARIE that he believes JACK is the killer; and despite the fact that she reacts brusquely and forces PETE to leave, Marie is affected.  She confronts JACK.  He doesn’t really confirm or deny it.


PETE confronts JACK; at gunpoint. PETE takes JACK to the woods; planning to kill him in the same fashion that Jack killed his victims.  JACK and PETE scuffle and JACK gets the upperhand; he  
chokes PETE and nearly kills him but lets him go at the last moment.   
JACK disappears .


Months later MARIE and PETE have moved on, but still a mysterious crowd hangs over their heads.  One night JACK shows up and terrifies Marie.  Marie, pregnant now, fights back, stabbing Jack and badly wounding him. Jack wanders into the woods and gets eaten by wolves.

A renowned wild guy shocks his friends by announcing he’s marrying a girl he’s only known for four months; they all come down for a wild wedding party weekend, and clash with her conservative family. 

COMMENTS 
Funny, like, I’d watch it on DVD because it’s mindless funny, but not something I’d recommend.  Would be good for popcorn in Middle East, but not really much else.  Definitely not arthouse.  Writer is behind such Americana as SUPERTROOPERS, DUKES OF HAZARD, CLUB DREAD and BEERFEST.  DVD value is American comedies work. 

In terms of the story, the characters are somewhat loveable, with a better than average feel to them, after about 50 pages you get to know them and the script is consistently amusing while never being laugh out loud funny. Plays like a neutered WEDDING CRASHERS.  

SUMMARY
PETE and NICK go out for a wild night in AUSTIN TEXAS; PETE meets a hot girl named KATE and the two hit it off and wind up sleeping together; NICK, on the other hand, fails miserably and gets blown off by Kate’s friend. 

Four Months later, PETE’s friends are all shocked by the news that he’s getting married. SAM and his overbearing wife ASHLEY are intrigued, “I have no idea who she is!”  ALEX, the gay republican congressional aide takes a vacation; a NICK hops a plane from LA to be with his buddy.  CECILIA, recently divorced, seems reluctant to attend.  “6 hour flight and five hour drive to watch Pete rush into a doomed marriage.” 

On the plane, NICK gets wasted and hits on the hot girl next to him; LESLIE.  He winds up kissing her, lying to her that he’s a writer for 24, and accidentally pissing his pants after she gives him a Xanex.  

They all meet up for a rehearsal dinner; PETE explains that his fiancé’s parents are really “old fashioned” and wont like any stories about his wild past, so he forces all his friends to give really boring speeches. 

NICK scores weed at the rehearsal dinner and he, PETE and the others get stoned.  COPS see them and arrest them. MR. FOSTER (Kate’s dad) is LIVID. ALEX pulls strings to get the charges dropped. 

The guys keep the party going after getting out, stealing booze from the hotel lobby bar and partying in their rooms. CECILIA winds up making out with some Southern guys, but the trouble is, she doesn’t know whether she was making out with LAIRD or TAYLOR. 

On wedding day, all the guys and girls split up for boat rides; DERRICK, KATE’S little brother, gets a hook stuck in his foot, so NICK gives him some weed as a painkiller and everyone on the boat gets wasted.  MR FOSTER is even more pissed off.  At the wedding, he glares fiercely at PETE, unhappy about the marriage. To make matters worse, everyone assumes KATE is pregnant, despite her insistence that she’s not. 

At the reception, KATE’s ex BOBBY shows up. (Taylor and Laird’s brother). PETE finds out that BOBBY and KATE had been engaged till a four months ago, which Pete calls, “a little whorey” and the entire party nearly turns into a brawl.  KATE’s parents whisk her away to their house where she is put on lockdown, while everyone else goes back and keeps partying, despite the fact that it’s “a little fucked up.” 

BOBBY shows up the party and has sex with ALEX, CECILIA nearly has a threesome with LAIRD and TAYLOR, and NICK and PETE engineer a jailbreak plan for KATE; 
Eventually, NICK gets drunk with MR FOSTER and smoothes everything over.  PETE and KATE admit to everyone that she really is pregnant.  Happy. Ever. After. The end.

A hot shot chef struggles to hold things together after the untimely death of his wife. 

COMMENTS 

 Well written, but DEPRESSING, the main character is a huge asshole in the beginning, and you realize that its because he's a widower. I just dont see an audience caring about him / or wanting to go watch the film.  Not to say its without merit. it's well written. 


SUMMARY  (from Filmbox) 

Tom is a man behaving badly. Apparently arrogant and selfish, he's involved with an unfeasible number of women in ways that we don't necessarily like. And he's neglecting his eight year old son, and his colleagues in the chic Sydney restaurant where he's the principal chef. 

Karen may be his ex-wife. She certainly plays that part at first. Always on Tom's case to face up to his responsibilities to his son, Oscar, and forced to conclude the boy will have to be taken from him. 

Sally is Tom's partner in the restaurant.  Everything they've built together is threatened by his reckless neglect. 

Miriam is a psychotherapist.  Perhaps Tom's.  Except he's having sex with her – a thrilling but dysfunctional affair firmly at odds with any professional relationship they may or may not be having. 

Lisa is a happily married woman. He sleeps with her but accuses her of feeding on his pain.  Carol was supposed to be selling Tom's house but now she's fucking him in a curly wig.  Marti just fucks him in a car.  Lesley is a prostitute. At least Tom knows the rules of that relationship.

There's a blind man, a car crash, a burning man screaming down the street towards us …… 


Tom wasn’t always like this.  One blissful day ten years ago he met Sarah.  She was perfect. Beautiful and sexy but so much more.  He was on the brink of success but the driven, brutal ambitious exterior concealed a man unsure of himself.  She inspired him. Blessed him and the food he cooked. Made him everything he was, gave him his wonderful Oscar. 

But the universe is an unkind place.  It gives and it takes away.  Watching Sarah die was more than any man should have to take. And now Tom is a man fearing that without her he will be nothing. A man seeing how far he must push the universe before it gives him an answer that makes sense.  

All the women in his world are trying in their own way to help put him back together. If grief is the price we pay for love, then Tom and his son must learn it's better to have experienced both than neither.

A priest in 1980s rural Ireland confronts his views on forgiveness, morality and his own secret guilt after hearing a shocking confession from a devout elderly couple. 

COMMENTS
This is one of those scripts I enjoyed and would watch onscreen, but I'm not sure that it has an obvious selling point or large demographic. Still, one must applaud the fact that the writer has succeeded in making the normally unpalatable subject of incest into something sympathetic and forgivable. The result is an achingly sweet love story (mostly platonic) and a tale of redemption from the burden born by good people who still have human flaws they believe they should be able to overcome. The intimate isolated setting and well-intended characters lend a cozy nostalgic atmosphere that seems distanced from the turmoil of the real world and the problems haunting Declan and Enda.   One point that didn't seem true to character was Father Declan's immediate condemnation of Enda and Kevin's relationship, although he was carrying his own guilty secret. There may have been an opportunity there to add another layer to their dynamic -- perhaps Declan secretly admired Enda and the revelation of her secret offended and hurt him personally. It also seems a shame that there wasn't a bit more closure to Father Declan's catastrophic incident when Enda's was so satisfactory. I felt the closure of his unfair judgment of Enda and Kevin's relationship, but not that of his own tragic past as much. The convivial wake scene towards the end felt a bit drawn out with several natural ending points that were strung out together, but after a tale of such woe it seems understandable to want several happy endings.  And from such tragic circumstances, the writer does manage to steer the story into an uplifting one about community and acceptance without being soppy or overly sentimental. There's a nice message here about forgiveness coming from those you love being just as valuable, if not more, than that of the church. Worth a read, at least; however, subject matter is not suited for a pre-buy

SUMMARY
The priest has known an elderly couple in his congregation for a long time and they're very dependable and devout. When the husband dies, he confesses the woman is not his wife and begs the priest to never desert her, no matter what truth is revealed. The priest promises but then learns from the 'wife' that they are not only unmarried, but brother and sister although it is a platonic relationship. When they were children, they had an extremely abusive father who took his anger at the children's mother (who deserted them for another man) out on them by working them relentlessly. Then in a fit of madness after news reaches them that the mother has died, he begins locking the children up in the mother's old room while he goes out drinking. The brother and sister support each other's morale, but when their father doesn't return for several days in the freezing winter, under the haze of hunger, cold and fear they become intimate. The incident never occurs again but the sister becomes pregnant. They run away together and the sister, now an old woman, tells the priest of how they did honest work to be able to find a place to start over, especially after she miscarried the child. 

Terrified of ever revealing the truth in their new town where they were now comfortably settled, they continued to live as man and wife although they slept separately, guilty of their one sin in their youth. The priest admits his own secret he has been bearing in silent guilt -- he heard a confession from an IRA bomb maker whose work had recently taken the lives of a school bus of children. The priest absolved him but was later taken in for interrogation by masked men who demanded to know who the bomb maker was. Because the confession can be revealed to no one but God, the priest refused to tell until they began torturing him. Once they broke both his legs, he admitted who the bomb maker was and learned later that the bomb maker, his wife and three children were all murdered because of his disclosure. 

Once the woman and the priest learn these secrets of one another, they begin the road to forgiving each other and themselves.

A courier who deals strictly with the underworld gets in deeper than he could've ever imagined with his latest assignment.

COMMENTS 

The Courier is an action/adventure story that defies logic at ever turn.  There are so many characters and so many references to people you barely see, or never see at all, that the story becomes far too confusing far too quickly to make it a worthwhile project.  Countless mistakes, unmotivated twist and turns, and a slew of characters whose allegiance is so difficult to figure out that it's impossible to know who to root for.  A deaf FBI agent whose job it is to give commands during stings, a lisping gangster who loses said lisp for no reason at all, and a crime syndicate led by a husband and wife who're skimming off a man's - Evil's - illegal businesses, who is also a secret FBI agent... And the Courier's character is another major problem.  Who he is, how he came to do this kind of work, and how he seems to know everyone wherever he goes comes off feeling way to convenient.  The story is just too farfetched and underdeveloped to take seriously.    

SUMMARY 

TONY is about to be killed by Mexican banditos atop a Mayan temple.  But at the last minute he's able to escape with the help of the COURIER, a young man who delivers him a detonating device, which blows the Mexican's to bits… Tony swears his undying allegiance to the Courier.

Back in his Chicago apartment the Courier steps out of his shower to find LISPY - a jewelry clad effeminate gangster who speaks with a lisp - in his kitchen.  He offers the Courier a million dollars to find and deliver an attaché case to the notorious EVIL SIVLE.  Not being able to turn down the highly dangerous offer, the Courier visits his various underworld contacts, looking for info on Evil's whereabouts.  He's followed by a crooked cop OLMSTEAD, who shows up and shoots one of his contacts in the face.  Olmstead then delivers the Courier to his bosses, MR. and MRS CAPOLILLO.  As soon as he's chained down in a torture room Mrs. Capolillo beats him, then Mr. Capolillo comes in and demands the case.  The Courier refuses, he only hands over his deliveries to their intended recipients.  He's beaten again and left in a junkyard.  The Courier then hails a cab and goes to JACK STRAW's hemp store.  After explaining to the Courier that Mr. and Mrs. Capolillo are after Evil because he let some ugly little mutt impregnate Mrs. Capolillo's prize German Shepard, the Courier pays a visit to his FBI contacts, RICHTER and the deaf SORDO.

The Courier learns from them that he was actually hired by the Capolillo's to find and kill Evil Sivle.  Wanting to help the Courier out - because he's aided them in the past with some of their cases - they start round-the-clock surveillance on him.  The Courier then calls Jack and tells him to put the word out on the street that he wants to deal with the Capolillos.  The Courier meets Olmstead in a mall food court, the attaché case at his side.  Once back in the torture room he gives the case to Mrs. Capolillo.  With a police swat team backing him up the Courier tries to get Mr. and Mrs. Capolillo to confess to past murders.  The cops burst in and arrest them after the Courier slyly pulls this off.  

Later Richter and Sordo tell the Courier that Evil was found dead in a retirement facility in Arizona.  Not believing the bogus overdose story the Courier travels to Arizona to get at the truth.  After pistol-whipping the manager around he learns that Lispy helped to fake Evil's death.  He locates Lispy and forces him to take him to Evil's art deco building.  The place is decorated like a Willy Wonka rain forest, and when Evil comes out of his hot tub he is pissed.  But a deal being a deal he pays the Courier, taking a jar of fireflies out of the attaché case.  Then all the lights go out and Lispy shoots Evil right between the eyes.  Wanting to setup the Courier for the murder, Lispy calls security, but the Courier is able to make a miraculous death defying escape.  

Once back with the feds the Courier tells that he doesn't believe that the man who was killed was Evil.  They go to view the body, then Richter and Sordo tell him the truth.  The man Lispy killed was an FBI agent, and so were all his guards.  But the Courier already knows this because he was the one who put the fireflies in the attaché case, trying to see if he could trust who he delivered it to.  Richter goes on to explain that the FBI made 'EVIL SIVLE' up to screw with the underworld.  Five different agents have played him going back to the fifties.  Now they are after Lispy, and need the Courier's help.  

Back at the apartment the Courier finds its been ransacked, the real attaché case gone.  His good-looking DJ neighbor ANNA is knocked out amidst the mess.  She'd gone over to invite him to dinner and Lispy had attacked her.  Needing extra help, the Courier locates NIPPY JONES, the man who hired him to help Tony in the Mexican jungle.  These guys are smugglers, and knowing that Lispy has a flight out of O'Hare planned, the Courier has them pose as security guards so they can steal the attaché case back.  They're able to swipe it when Lispy's jewelry sets off the metal detectors, and with info from the feds, learn that Mr. and Mrs. Capolillo are both about to be transferred to different prisons. 

Tony, after knocking out a prison guard and taking his uniform, is able to capture Mrs. Capolillo.  Nippy and the Courier meanwhile have captured Mr. Capolillo.  Threatening to harm his wife, they force him to give up the attaché case and Evil's whereabouts.  The Courier heads straight to the Luxor hotel in Las Vegas.  After snooping around an Elvis impersonator catches his eye… Then the Courier sees his marquee reflected backwards in a mirror: '!EVIL SIVLE'.  The Courier chases Evil, running atop roulette tables and slot machines.  Soon his goons are chasing him through the halls, and the Courier runs right into Lispy, who is dressed normally, lisp now gone.  Lispy points his uzi at him but the Courier is able to escape out a window, climbing the pyramid, eventually making it to Evil's office.  The Courier delivers him the attaché case, Evil explaining that he works for the feds AND is an underworld boss, playing both sides.  Having completed the job Evil goes to pay him but the Courier refuses the money.  He just wanted to get to the bottom of it all.  And once back home the fed are so impressed with his work that they hire him to locate other hard to find individuals.

After a bar fight turns ugly, MIKE (Paul Walker), a young Marine, is thrown out of the Corps. Two years later he’s moved from North Carolina to South Boston. His wife has left him, and his only chance at getting custody of his young daughter is to succeed as a firefighter. While Mike struggles to impress his colleagues – and his gruff mentor O’BRIEN – he falls in love with JILL, a beautiful, formerly innocent girl with a dealer boyfriend, KEVIN.
 
COMMENTS:
Read the first half and found absolutely nothing surprising or unique on the page; coupling that with Paul Walker’s promise of a leaden lead performance and I’d say this one is an easy pass.  Story follows a clichéd trajectory down a predictable path.  It’s violent, it’s got drugs and graphic imagery and a “streets of Boston” setting meant to conjure images of THE DEPARTED or other superior gangster flicks, but this one falls short. 
 
SUMMARY (of first half… ):

",,,,,,,"LOGLINE:
When David invites his closest friends to his wedding in Australia, he has no idea that he will have to frantically cover-up their misadventures while trying to make a good impression on his new family.  But waking up on his wedding day with a blinding hangover and a prize-winning goat in his room is only the first of the surprises in store for him.

COMMENTS:
Fast-paced and funny, full of situational comedy and some gross-out humor. The jokes are pretty juvenile, but good spirited.  It aspires to be The Hangover, but lacks the “anything-can-happen” glamorous setting of Las Vegas, replacing it with an Australian farm.  This weakens it in some ways, and the plot has predictable moments, but the brisk pace and dialogue is engaging as the characters get themselves into increasingly precarious situations.  Worth considering further.

SUMMARY:
After a year of traveling, DAVID (30, an orphan) returns home to London and tells his best friends, TOM, GRAHAM, and LUKE that he is marrying an Australian girl, MIA, and wants them to be his best men.  They agree, and we rejoin the four friends in Heathrow Airport three months later, on the way to the wedding.  As they make their way to Australia, we learn that TOM is confident and rash, LUKE’s girlfriend left him for a man whose penis was lost in a boating accident, and GRAHAM is insecure, attempting to grow a moustache (which unfortunately looks like Hitler’s), and has brought along a ‘gimp mask’ as a gag gift for DAVID.

Arriving in Australia, TOM, GRAHAM, and LUKE take a detour to buy some weed from a guy TOM found on craigslist.  Depressive LUKE stays in the car while TOM and GRAHAM meet violent dealer RAY, who shows them a bag full of cocaine-filled condoms and a handgun and takes a special interest in befriending GRAHAM while TOM is in the bathroom.  They eventually manage to escape and make their way to the farm.",,a few best men.docx

COMMENTS:  MENTAL is a zany comedy.  Its plot throws a nonconformist vagabond into the midst of a suburban family strangely drawn to the notion of mental illness.  The story has some commonalities with recent ribald comedies like THE HANGOVER or SUPERBAD in its bawdy humor and outlandish situations.  The similarities likely end there as the oddball story is likely better suited to video release than the broader theatrical audience.

UPSIDE:  The characters are memorable.  Their fascination with and seeming desire for psychosis certainly sets MENTAL apart from most films.  The tale of young misfits finding themselves is a prototype that has seen success in the past.

DOWNSIDE:  The script fails to clearly demarcate its main character, shifting the focus from one momentary protagonist to another, which creates difficulties in finding a point of identification.  The characters dance between pleasantly peculiar and unbelievably absurd and too often falter into the latter category.  The script wholly undermines the credibility and likability of a central character and moves on with the story without any real acknowledgment that this is a problem.

SYNOPSIS:  ACT I.  CORAL MOOCHMORE, 16, searches the internet for information on schizophrenia, from which Coral is positive she suffers.  Coral remembers unusual behavior from her childhood, including a suicide attempt her family still refuses to discuss.  SHIRLEY, Coral’s mother, calls her down to dinner, protesting they should eat together as if they were a normal family.  Coral joins her sisters KAYLEEN, LEANNE, MICHELE, and JANE at the table as they debate which of them has the most significant mental problems.

BARRY, Shirley’s husband and the girls’ father, fails to make it home in time for dinner.  Shirley believes this is because as a family they are an embarrassment, but Shirley plans to whip them into the image of “normality”.  NANCY BOYLE, the Moochmores’ neighbor, watches with disdain as Shirley backs out of the driveway and runs over her trash bins.  Nancy yells at Shirley calling her a disgrace to the neighborhood.

Shirley visits a coffee shop, where the two proprietors, MANDA and KAY, sell her a doughnut she does not really want.  Shirley’s prim and proper sister, DORIS, joins her and scolds Shirley for eating the doughnut.  Doris babbles about her competitive doll-making as Shirley worries about her failing marriage.  When Shirley gets upset and causes a scene, Doris recommends another doughnut to calm her down.

Coral continues her schizophrenia research as she reports to work at an amusement park.  TROUT, an attractive boy, tells her she has been assigned to a shark show in the basement.  TREVOR BLUNDELL, owner of the new shark amusement, scares Coral while explaining the sharks.  Michele, the only Moochmore girl genuinely suffering from mental illness, experiences voices and hallucinations.  Vast quantities of furniture begin to arrive at the Moochmore house.  Barry, the city council president, receives a message from his buxom secretary, TISHA, about the emergency at his house.  Jane arrives home with a new haircut after her aunt Doris stole Jane’s hair for a doll.  Coral sings and dances in the yard, impersonating her idea of the perfect family, the Von Trapps from The Sound of Music.

ACT II.  Barry commits his wife to an institution.  The girls ask to see a psychiatrist for their real or imagined mental problems.  Barry informs them they are not allowed to go mental.  Barry worries about his own sanity with JACK, a colleague.  Barry spots a HITCH-HIKER on the road and picks her up.  He takes the Hitch-Hiker home and puts her in charge of the girls, whose names Barry struggles to remember.  Shaz (the Hitch-Hiker) begins whipping the girls into shape with the help of her dog, Ripper.

Shaz takes a walk, her hooker-esque clothing drawing suspicious stares from the suburban NEIGHBORS.  The girls search Shaz’s bag and find, among other things, drugs, drug paraphernalia, and books on sharks and mental illness that Coral also has.  Shaz learns the gossip about the crazy Moochmore family from Nancy and her daughter, DONNA.  Later, Doris grows concerned when Shaz answers her telephone call.  Doris pulls into the driveway to check things out but refuses to come in since she always finds her sister’s home to be too dirty.  Shaz and Ripper investigate, gathering information about Shirley from Doris.

Coral shows Trout the sharks after hours at the park.  Trout unexpectedly begins kissing her and taking off her clothes.  Coral does not mind – until she hears something.  Trout is not in a hurry to stop, until Trevor Blundell arrives and zaps him with a shark stunner.  He tells Trevor he will have to wait a couple years with Coral.  Coral is less than pleased.

Trevor tells Coral that Trout is no good for her, that he is a shark.  Coral finds this an odd statement and says it does not matter since she soon expects to succumb to schizophrenia.  Trevor also considers madness to be a kind of shark.  He tells Coral to hold onto herself, even if she is not all that great, because that is all she has.  At the institution, Shirley speaks to a therapist, who turns out to be Shaz.  Shirley tells Shaz about meeting Barry:  they were on a date, Barry drank too much and raped her, and Shirley became pregnant with Coral, which forced them to be together.  Shaz runs into one of her friends, SANDRA, who has also been institutionalized.

Shaz tells Sandra and Shirley they are only perceived as crazy because they allow themselves to be.  Shaz plans to help them, but first, she must take care of Shirley’s other problems.  Shaz and Ripper wake the Moochmore girls up at 2:00 a.m. and force them to climb a mountain.  At the top, Shaz informs them that they are not mental…except for Michele.  But Shaz plans to fix Michele, as well.  Coral struggles with this news, since it means they are just unpopular, not crazy.

Shaz begins convincing the girls that everyone in all of Australia is crazy, and there is no normal.  She also relates a ridiculous story that she is chased by the government for her instinctive nonconformity and she needs the Moochmore girls (fellow instinctive nonconformists, though beaten down and unrecognizable due to the “Forces of Conformity”) to join her army.  The girls are intrigued.

Shaz attacks and terrorizes Manda and Kay to discourage them from their doughnut pushing ways.  The younger girls are excited by Shaz’s audacity and the thought that they are special, but Coral remains suspicious.  Shaz tells Coral other people can only have power over her if Coral allows them to.  At Shaz’s urging, Coral makes up a story to protect Shaz when the DETECTIVES arrive for questions about the doughnut shop.

Shaz leads Sandra and the Moochmore girls in an intervention for Nancy’s perceived obsessive compulsive disorder.  Once finished terrorizing Nancy, Shaz and the Moochmores celebrate as they watch their distressed neighbor burn all of her “contaminated” furniture in the backyard.  Coral embraces her quirks and intrigues Trout with her boldness.  They go skinny dipping and begin to make love after hours at the amusement park.  Shaz breaks into the shark amusement and Trevor, who knows her from previous encounters, threatens her life.

Tisha interrupts Barry during his affair with a woman at the office to report another emergency at the Moochmore home.  The emergency proves to be a ruse for Shaz’s attempt to force Barry to spend time with his daughters.  Shaz wakes Barry up late that night to show him where Michele has been sleeping under the house to avoid the voices in her head.  Barry is crushed and tries to comfort his daughter.  Shaz confesses that she was once married to Trevor and enlists the help of the Moochmore girls in recovering her daughter, whom Trevor holds against her will.

Barry contacts a psychiatrist to help Michele overcome her schizophrenia.  Shaz kidnaps Doris’s dolls and forces her to meet with Shirley and apologize for the horrible way she has treated her sister over the years.  Barry and the girls make it to the gathering, as well.  They all ask Shirley to come home.  Shaz brings her up to date on the news around the neighborhood.  Nancy’s daughter, Donna, has eloped with Sandra.  Nancy lost her mind and has been committed.  Shirley thanks Shaz for her help.  Shaz admits she is not a real doctor.  Barry and Doris exchange a meaningful look.

ACT III.  Shaz and the girls scout the boat where Trevor holds KIM, Shaz’s daughter.  Coral finds the keys to the boat and sneaks aboard, but she cannot find Kim and Trevor catches her.  Shaz prepares the other girls for a raid on Trevor’s shark show, where they plan to steal one of his preserved sharks.  Coral comes home and is enlisted.  Barry and Doris arrive with police to arrest Shaz.

Shaz and the girls sneak out and steal Doris’s car.  Coral relates what Trevor told her about Kim:  Kim was a drug addict and drowned.  Shaz slams on the brakes and holds a knife to Coral’s throat.  Shaz insists Kim was taken by a shark, the same shark she plans to steal.  Coral tells the other girls that everything Shaz told them was a lie.  She does not think they are special.  They were only week enough to be pulled into her plan to steal the shark.  Shaz admits all of this is true, but she insists her daughter’s soul calls out to her from the shark, and it must be returned to the ocean.

When they arrive at the amusement park, no one is willing to follow Shaz but Ripper.  The other girls beg her to run away and avoid being caught, but Shaz leads Ripper toward the shark.  The authorities apprehend Shaz.  Later, Shirley visits Shaz at a mental institution.  She comes home to dinner and Trevor stops by to tell them he is leaving town.  He is very drunk and very rude and soon passes out.  But not before saying he once had a happy family and lost it.  Shirley and the girls visit Barry at the office and find he has really not changed at all throughout the recent events.  Shirley informs him that he is officially leaving her and throws him a suitcase full of his things.

Trevor comes to and is tied up on the couch.  Trout is there to watch him and tells Trevor the girls have stolen his shark.  Shaz and the girls meet Sandra and Donna at the mental institution.  They try to see Shaz, but she refuses.  The girls begin singing and draw Shaz’s attention.  Nancy finds Sandra with Donna and attacks Sandra.  In the confusion, Shirley and the girls help Shaz escape.  Trevor saws through his bonds with a shark tooth key chain and uses a shark prod to subdue Trout.

Shaz, Shirley, and the girls drive the shark to the ocean and try to break the case that holds it.  Trevor arrives and aims a rifle at Shaz.  Shaz tells him to either kill her or help her because she will never stop trying to free Kim’s spirit until she is dead.  Trevor fires, but at the shark case, not Shaz.  He helps the others drag the shark into the ocean, but his foot gets caught and Trevor is dragged into the water.  Shaz dives in after him, and Coral dives in after Shaz.  Coral can do nothing to help as Shaz and Trevor are dragged down to the depths.

Sometime later, Barry waits sadly outside the Moochmore house.  Shirley believes he only wants them for his political campaign, but the girls encourage her, asking her to consider what Shaz would do.  At his campaign launch, Barry begins awkwardly singing to the ridicule of his gathered supporters.  Shirley and the girls join him on stage with their own beautiful singing, and the audience joins in, turning the event into a huge success.  Doris scoffs at the reports of the event in the newspaper.  Shaz, who survived her near drowning, arrives at Doris house.  She sets Doris’s prized doll aflame with a lighter and her own flatulence.

SUSAN COMMENTS
Despite the perhaps silly sounding synopsis, this script is a really good read.  Witty, fun, some great secular vs. God arguments and well drawn characters.  It is kind of a caper and really not religious per se – sort of holding the mirror up to society and does not take itself too seriously.  Pierce Brosnan as the Dan character I think will be hilarious and Greg Kinnear would not have been the obvious choice for Carl but I think will be good in the role nonetheless.  Nice way to rekindle the two after MATADOR, which I adored.  I presume Ed Harris is Peter Blaylock and Jen Garner will be Gwen – all very good casting.  I would definitely suggest that James read this as I do think there is something here.  I would think the ensemble cast is strong enough to attract buyers and for me, the script delivers.  Jorge is a great character and I almost wish there were more scenes with him as he is so great yet ridiculous – perfect gentleman villain.  I would not necessarily say that this is a slam dunk however it is quite original, I love how it questions religious fanaticism and sort of equates (rightly so in my mind) these followers with Jerry Garcia (Grateful Dead) followers.  This is smart and I think could actually work. 

Not sure if this is completely financed or if they are actually looking for money on this or just sales.  Would like to discuss with everyone before I start asking Celine questions.  

Would love for Rob and sales to read as I think there is something here, despite that the budget may be $1M too high. 

STEVE COMMENTS
I agree with Susan; other than strongly despising the actual title, I found the script fresh and funny and smartly written; the writer throws in clever visual flares (jump cutting from CARL smoking pot to a mural at a lab)... he cleverly toys with the notion of blind faith in both religion and alternate lifestyles. The characters are all strong and funny, and the roles are cast really well. 

It reminds me of earlier/ weirder Coens, also Alexander Payne and a bit Little Miss sunshine (though it doesn’t really have that strong underdog theme).  On the downside; the director isn't Coen or Payne... and that's my only real hesitation.  If it’s directed poorly, the clever witty style could get muddled and it could just wind up silly. Worth reading for sure. 

SUMMARY
We meet CARL at the mega Church of the Third Millenium as he, his wife GWEN, father-in-law JIM are all listening to Pastor DAN DAY preaching as he is about to debate secular Professor PETER BLAYLOCK.  Pastor DAN is  going on about how he sees evidence in God every day and asks if there is any evidence of God there that night – GWEN shouts out “yes, my husband”, meaning CARL, the onetime Grateful Dead follower who was saved once he stumbled into the Church, met Gwen and her 16 year old ANGIE.  PETER claims that CARL traded one drug for another when he apparently found God.  After the debate, PETER sort of challenges DAN to have a drink with him and DAN wants to bring CARL, his example, along.  CARL’s father-in-law, JIM, who is not a huge CARL fan, is actually very excited because he has a proposal that he wants CARL to give to Pastor DAN for a movie theater for showing all Christian films at the new City on the Hill – a planned community site for believers that DAN is erecting – a major undertaking.  DAN and CARL go to PETER’s office to chat – CARL totally uncomfortable for several reasons – one of which is because he is sober and can’t drink.  PETER and DAN go at it – clearly PETER is an erudite, renaissance type man and has a large collection of antiques and Revolution era paraphernalia.  While they are verbally sparring DAN picks up an old flintlock rifle and starts gesticulating with it to make a point.  It goes off and PETER goes flying backwards in his chair.  CARL is in shock, wants to call 911.  DAN says no, waits, wipes the gun handle off on his shirt then places it in PETER’s outstretched hand!

As they leave the scene of the crime, CARL notices a security camera above.  He is in a panic and still wants to call 911 – DAN persuades him that if he calls, the ground breaking for City on the Hill will never happen and they can’t do that to his followers.  CARL realizes he’s sunk.  When DAN leaves, CARL calls 911 reporting a gunshot noise from PETER’s office.  DAN is pacing at home, nervous when his phone rings – an unknown call from “a friend” who knows all of his secret but still wants the best for him.  DAN hangs up.  DAN gets into his Escalade and drives to the low-rent area of town to parishioner JERRY HOBSON’s house – we have met JERRY already at the church as he is the techy A/V guy, also a pal of CARL’s.  Throughout, the unknown caller keeps ringing DAN’s cell phone.  The next morning his wife tells him that JERRY called on the phone to say that everything is going to be fine – all was taken care of.

Everyone is at church – CARL is surprised to see Dan bounding in and up to the pulpit.  He announces that PETER is in the hospital, the victim of an attempted suicide after last night’s debate!  JERRY is taping the whole service.  DAN uses this opportunity to talk about spiritual despair.  Coming out of church, JERRY corners CARL and asks for a word.  Tells him to keep moving and act normal.  He sneaks CARL out of the massive church compound.  Tells him that DAN told him everything – lets CARL know that DAN has made CARL accountable for everything, including the shooting, and JERRY is there to ensure that DAN stays protected.  JERRY has a pistol sticking out of his jacket as he forces CARL to drive. JERRY has the gun at CARL’s temple and is about to shoot when CARL’s 16 year old step daughter awakens in the back if the minivan – CARL smashes JERRY in the head with a rock.  

CARL and ANGIE meet GWEN and JIM for lunch, trying to explain what happened – ANGIE totally vouching for CARL.  JIM and GWEN cannot believe it.  JIM does not want to do anything to endanger the new City on the Hill construction which is why he does not want to hear this.  CARL realizes he has no alternative, excuses himself to use the restroom and sneaks out the back.  He wears a hat and glasses as he approaches campus and finds a security guard, HONEY FOSTER, who approached him after the night before’s service and confided that she too used to be a Grateful Dead follower, baring her Dancing Bear tattoo.  CARL knows she’ll be sympathetic and asks her to sneak him into look at the security tapes to help clear his name however; the tape has already been EDITED.  He checks the list of everyone who has been through there and JERRY’s name is on the list.

GWEN and JIM go to speak to DAN who tries to insinuate that CARL is a big unhinged and may attempt suicide himself.  As DAN is going on and on, JIM notices the folder for his movie theater idea that he gave to CARL to take to DAN the night before.  He notices a spot on it – blood.  JIM takes the folder to the campus where PETER was a professor and into a lab – he gets the spot analyzed and as suspected, it is blood.

Meanwhile, HONEY and CARL have smoked a joint and are talking philosophically.  They are driving out of the city, listening to the ‘Dead.  Out of nowhere, a van with the Virgin Mary painted on its sides and back smashes into them – men with bandanas over their faces and guns jumps out and kidnap CARL.  He is masked and drugged.  When the accident is reported GWEN goes nuts wondering what HONEY is doing with CARL.  In the meantime, Jim goes to the police station with the blood splattered folder – the cop offers to open an investigation.

DAN goes to the hospital to look in on PETER who is in a coma.  Tries speaking to him – asks him for a sign that he is ready to depart this life, even administers last rites but nothing happens.  DAN is willing him to die but he doesn’t.  DAN spies the respirator and stares intently at the on/off switch...

CARL wakes up in what he thinks is Mexico – meets his handsome Latino kidnapper JORGE who shows him a DVD, shot outside of PETER’s office the night of the shooting.  We see DAN gesticulating with the gun and we see it go off.  CARL is thrilled – a friend who is on his side, however, JORGE wants something: a signed confession by CARL stating that he witnessed the unprovoked shooting of Peter Blaylock by Dan Day AND then another signed confession stating that CARL himself shot PETER!  He wants to bribe DAN – he is looking to build his own City on the Hill but needs Dan out of the way.  He is offering DAN a deal.  Only glitch is if PETER should wake up from his coma.  JORGE is a generous host – while he is drunk, CARL steals the DVD with the evidence of DAN’s shooting.  As DAN is making an appearance at the City on the Hill, he finally answers the Unknown call, who we now know is JORGE, who is offering him a deal.  CARL sneaks out of JORGE’s when he goes to meet with DAN – only to find out he is in California and not Mexico as he believed.

DAN and JORGE meet privately – JORGE tells DAN what he wants and goes to show him the evidence DVD but it is just a porno of JORGE and his wife.  DAN is outraged, starts slapping JORGE saying “I cast you out!”  JORGE pulls out a knife and plunges it into DAN’s stomach.  Carl is sitting in a diner as a news alert comes on TV; PETER has awakened from his coma and says the shooting was not a suicide attempt.  The police officer JIM spoke with comes to get CARL, but then goes to also pick up JERRY.  CARL tried to make a run for it to no avail.  He is taken to an abandoned factory where he is tied up and JERRY tries dousing him with gasoline, yet JERRY has no matches and tried to ignite CARL using the cop’s taser gun.  It backfires, the spark travels backwards igniting the gas can and the cop.  CARL tries to make a run for it but JERRY tackles him – he is badly burned and winded, dies.  CARL escapes.  At this point he realizes the evidence DVD is smashed and broken.  He takes off toward the highway where he staggers to a motel – turns out the motel clerk was also a Grateful Dead follower, recognizes him and welcomes him.  The motel guy has a copy of DAN DAY’s book which CARL starts to read.  Somehow wanders off to the City on the Hill to an old theater where he witnesses an amazing dance performance by an elderly woman.  She and her husband, two old hippies who ended up out there escaping from it all, take him in.  CARL passes out in their hammock only to be awakened by his father-in-law, JIM.  Turns out that the old theater is the same one JIM wanted to put his movie theater – JIM had come for the ground-breaking ceremony for City on the Hill which is that day.  JIM apologizes for doubting CARL and knows he’s innocent.

The ceremony is supposed to begin – DAN’s Escalade is seen but no DAN.  CARL tells ANGIE that he is going to have to go away for a little while but to look after her mom.

A tsunami hits a small town and strands victims inside a supermarket.  To make matters worse, the aisles are not only flooded, but swarming with sharks. 

COMMENTS

This is an over the top premise with an over the top script. There are sure to be some exciting sequences, but the filmmakers don’t even try to tease out all the tension and scares from an already ridiculous premise and resort to adding gun fights, a bus load of convicts and a home made bomb detonated by a misanthropic crazy person; and none of these devices make much sense.  The best sequence is the sharks attacking while floating in the flooded supermarket aisles;  cinematic, scary, unique.  Everything else was just ridiculous and over the top.  Sanctum is a far superiour 3D project. 

SUMMARY 

In a small Australian town where the residents never have to worry about much more than the occasional shark attack, policewoman TRACY brings her troublesome teenage son JIM to the local supermarket which has just opened.   Tracy interrupts a robbery in progress, opening fire on thief SAM, who shoots SUSAN, the story manager in the back.  In the middle of the shootout they are disrupted by a massive  tsunami that floods the market. 

The customers, workers, the mayor, the thief, Tracy, Jim, Susan (bloody from the gunshot) and several others are forced to swim to the top of the shelves and pray for rescue, but the situation gets even more dire when they realize that the flood waters are infested with Sharks. There are literally sharks swimming around the aisles of the grocery store. 

One of the stranded survivors tries to get out through a ventilation shaft but gets eaten by a shark that jumps out of the water.

A heroic survivor, JOSH, sees a power chord that’s about to hit the rising water and realizes they’ll all be electrocuted. He creates a makeshift shark suit out of wire mesh, pantyhose and a breathing apparatus out of garden hose and swims to the electrical room and cuts the power to the building.  The criminal, SAM, loses his mind, creates a raft out of the dead bodies of survivors and rigs a homemade bomb, presumably to kill everyone.  Tracy manages to shoot and kill Sam, but the bomb goes off anyway, blowing a hole through the wall and helping the stranded people escape.  

Outside, they see the tsunami has thoroughly destroyed the landscape.

An Indian woman runs off with her seven year old daughter to save her from being forced into a marriage with a much older man.
 
COMMENTS
A brutally forthright script about the horrors associated with the repressed lives of females in Muslim society, – women in the film are raped, abused and one is literally stoned to death.   The fugitive plot starts off powerfully, but the chase lags and the ending left me feeling vacant rather than moved – in a film with no hope, a tragic ending is not a surprise.  The romance between Allah and Sohail had some good moments, and the imagery of the merging rivers was powerful, but again, the resolution (he drops her off at the consulate before changing his mind and rushing back a moment too late…) was disappointing.  With strong performances and direction it could be a strong festival type pic.
 
SUMMARY
ALLAH RAKHI, a 25 year old woman, cooks is married to a tribal chief DAULAT KHAN, 76, who fawns over her and adores her cooking.  Allah, who already has a seven year old daughter ZAINAB with him, secretly takes birth control pills to avoid another pregnancy.  Daulat believes it is right as a husband to have his way with her sexually, even during her period, at which point he practically rapes her in the ass.
 
Daulat’s friend HASHIM KHAN takes a liking to young Zainab and asks to marry her.  Allah is devastated when Daulat tells her that her daughter must marry the lecherous old man (who also happens to be Zainab’s Uncle).  Upset that his wife be so insolent, he locks Allah in her room so that she can’t interfere with the wedding, only letting her out when she agrees not sabotage the wedding plans. Allah’s protestations come from her own experiences, she was forced to marry Daulat when she was also a very young girl, and still has nightmares about being raped on their wedding night. She wants her daughter to be spared the same fate. 
 
The wedding goes off without a hitch, but Allah manages to sneak away with Zainab, escaping after the ceremony and running for the highway.  The runaways are picked up by SOHAIL, a truck driving scamp reluctant to help.  Upon finding out the women have disappeared, Daulat and his nephew SHEBAZ (a violent man who fancies Allah Rakhi) chase after them in an armored van, armed with machine guns.  Daulat is desperate to find the women before sunrise to avoid Hashim being shamed publicly for his wife’s disappearance. 
 
SOHAIL realizes that they are being chased and decides to pull over and immediately turn the women over to their pursuers, realizing that they’ve put his life at risk.  Allah pulls out a gun and holds it to her head, vowing to commit suicide rather than be returned to Daulat.  Sohail reluctantly agrees to help them, and hides them in his truck.  Dolait and Shebaz pull him over at gunpoint and search the vehicle, but find nothing.  Sohail lies, telling them that he dropped the women off in a different town. 
 
At a truckstop, Sohail runs into his deceased wife’s brother (his former brother in law) who sees the women and reports them to the police, who in turn, alert Dolait.  Back on the road, Sohail is stopped by police, but convinces them that Allah is his wife. 
 
They make it to a bridge where two major rivers meet, but realize they need to cross treacherous mountains guarded by gangs, and cannot make it in their truck.  ZAINED wanders off and nearly falls through the rickety bridge over the rivers, but ABDULLAH, a wise old man, saves the child’s life.  Abdullah promises to help the fugitives by driving the truck around the mountain, and insists that the only way they can make it to the other side is to cut through the mountain.
 
In the mountains they are kidnapped by the gangs, but Allah saves the warlord’s wife’s life, so the gangster allows her to pass.  On the other side of the mountain they are relieved to find that Abdullah has kept his word.  Aware that their truck has been identified, they swap it for his minivan and head to Lenore in the desperate hopes of rendezvousing with Allah’s mother TASNEEM.  Tasneem has already been approached by Dolait and she has agreed to cooperate; she agrees to meet Allah in the town square, but doublecrosses her daughter… Dolait and his men are able to nab Zained, but Solait and Allah escape.  Allah sneaks into Dolaits hideout and helps Zained escape. Solait drives the women (whom he’s fallen in love with) to the human rights consulate where he believes they will be safe.  While a lawyer briefs Allah as to her rights, her mother Tasneem shows up and asks to see Allah.  When she is let in, Tasneem shoots and kills Allah, her daughter.

TITLE: Precious 
DIRECTOR: Frederik du Chau
CAST: Cuba Gooding JR, Franka Potenta, Viola Davis, Rutger Hauer 
STATUS: In Development 
GENRE: Biopic / Sports 
READER: Steven Murphy

LOGLINE

Based on the inspirational true story of South African-born British Olympian Precious McKenzie, MBE, who overcomes an abusive childhood, racism, apartheid and injury to become a gold medalist weight lifter. 
 
COMMENTS

Very middle of the road, geared for older, sentimental crowds.  The writing is very pedestrian, not very stylish at all, and takes what could have been an interesting story and structures in fairly dull fashion.  I love sports movies, but this one, though having the potential to be inspirational and moving, missed the mark.  Similarly, weight lifting isn’t a particularly cinematic sport. Pass. 

SUMMARY 

In the wilderness of South Africa, a man dies while hunting crocidile.  His young son PRECIOUS has been deemed to sick to deserve treatment, and his mother fears he will die. 

Years later, in the early 60s in South Africa, PRECIOUS is now a national champion weight lifter trying to get a spot on the Olympic team.

Despite handily beating all of the whites at the segregated trials, PRECIOUS is left off the team.  The white leadership of the country, namely HERTZOG, threaten PRECIOUS.  His friends all want him to stop fighting back, fearful of the government and of the secret police. “If you keep chasing your dream you’ll either end up in prison or dead.” 

FB to a memory of PRECIOUS and his sister being beaten as children.  Child services take them away from ALICE.

PRECIOUS holds a public weight lifting event to prove he should make the Olympics; the press is converted; “in his country, being the best just isn’t good enough! Pound for pound he’s the strongest man in the republic.” 

FB – their mother sends them away to live with priests. He spends his youth in the priest’s orphanage, where he is able to hone his athletic talents. 

HERTZOG reluctantly lets PRECIOUS join the Olympic team, but they put so many immasculating restrictions on the “kaffir’s” participation that PRECIOUS quits and tries out for the British team. PRECIOUS has to fight again with the corrupt officials, but he manages to get an exchange to Britain through work.

HERTZOG worries that SOUTH AFRICA will look very bad if PRECIOUS wins, so he hires intelligence agents to sabotage PRECIOUS.  They loosen a clip on his weights which result in him breaking his arm.

The injury threatens to ruin his career, but PRECIOUS battles back and wins gold at the Commonwealth games and goes to the Olympics three times.

COMMENTS
Not very good script; genre stuff.  Standard plotting, kids do a lot of drugs and have to fight against a psycho; not captivating.   The visuals have the potential to be interesting if the director plays with the psychodelic mental torture of having to fight against a deranged killer whilst the heroes are tripping, but the story wasn’t written particularly well for me, and felt like low budget exploitation fare.  Popcorn only, piece of business and not a particularly strong one. 

SUMMARY
LLOYD, 22, a British thug, gets out of prison and reunites with his old gang mates JASON, COL, GARY, KELLY and his girlfriend YASMINE, who is pregnant with (presumably) Lloyd’s baby. 

The crew head into an abandoned building to help their buddies transmit a pirate radio signal, and the gang starts partying hard.  Jealous JASON, the crew’s leader who feels threatened by Lloyd’s return, actually drugs LLOYD, and the entire group starts tripping.  After YASMINE and LLOYD get into an argument, she disappears, and their fun evening turns horribly wrong.  LLOYD becomes convinced that there is someone else in the building and his fears prove true; there’s a mysterious killer lurking in the building who begins hunting them like vermin.  He kidnaps YASMINE, he kills GARY by burning him to death, and one by one the gang starts dying off.  COL falls down an elevator shaft to his death. 

LLOYD and YASMINE barely escape alive. The killer, demented RAY, survives as well.

COMMENTS
Disliked it; written like a poor stage play; the dialog between the villainous doctor, the cheating wife and the victim is wooden, stitled, fake and frustrating.  A few of the scenes are scary and tense and the acid burning element is somewhat unique.   Popcorn, piece of biz but I dont recommend.

SUMMARY
A gorgeous woman MEGAN entertains a man in her home, but the problem is, he’s not her husband; and when her husband PHILIP returns, he chases the flummoxed JAMES out of the house at gunpoint, but doesn’t seem to have the nerve to kill him, a point which MEGAN holds over Philip’s head. 

PHILIP, in a fit of jealous vengefulness, kidnaps JAMES and begins holding him hostage in a small cell, feeding him the same meals ever day, and tormenting both JAMES and MEGAN, who has no idea what happened to her lover.   

The police begin investigating and eventually realize the connection between the missing person and PHILIP, but not before PHILIP sets forth the final stage of his plan: he kills JAMES and dissolves his body in acid. 

MEGAN meanwhile has taken another lover.   Philip disappears, but not before burning Megan’s skin with acid and kidnapping her second lover.

15 year old Billy Conway believes that the world is a dangerous place and that accidents can happen at any time. His strongly held belief is based on bitter experience - from a very young age Billy has found himself inexplicably drawn to extremes of injury and misadventure. Billy's story is the suprising tale of how a good boy's bad behavior might just manage to save his very dysfunctional family.


COMMENTS:
Well written, with interesting sequences, but the dark comedy misses its mark and the melancholy of the piece could have been handled with more grace; Geena Davis’ character’s foul mouth could have been a major asset to the story, but her dialog was awkward, with poor comic timing.  First time director. Not a prebuy.

SUMMARY:
As a young man, Billy Conway witnesses his neighbor MR SMOLENSKY burn to death after an accident with a grill.  A few years later, Billy also plays an integral role in accidentally causing a car crash that kills his sister, and leaves his rambunctious older brother GENE in a vegetative state.  After a few years, Billy’s parents have grown apart, the trauma a festering wound that the family never recovers from.  When Billy befriends Gene’s former best friend DOUG POST, the pair spend a night pulling childish pranks reminiscent of Gene’s antics.  After robbing a liquor store in the nude, they steal a bowling ball and toss it back and forth in the street.  The ball flies into the road, causing MR. POST, Doug’s father to veer off into a telephone pole.  MR. POST dies. Devastated, the two boys cover their tracks, but Billy’s brother LARRY (gene’s twin) suspects Billy had something to do with it.  Doug is so distraught about causing his father’s death that he forces Billy to come to the police headquarters, where the two admit their fault in the incident.  The police believe that Doug and Billy are making up the story; the insurance company has ruled the death a suicide and refused to pay; the cops think that Doug and Billy have fabricated the tale in order to refute that decision. Doug and Billy have sex. Gene dies.  MRS. SMOLENSKY reveals that she recovered the bowling ball from the crash site in order to give Billy a second chance at life.

The stories of five mothers, whose frayed relationships with their children set their disastrous paths in motion.

COMMENTS:

Blessed is a traffic-jammed mess of characters and storylines. The structure is reminiscent of “PULP FICTION” and “GO,” though unlike similar films that employ this structure, there’s very little overlap between the parallel stories here.  We watch the mass of characters through a window, never given ample time to dip into their range of emotions.  Blessed explores a delicate balance between mothers and their troubled teenage children. For the most part, the dialogue is sharp, and the mood effectively tragic, but several stories, like Bianca’s, feel completely unnecessary. The threads rush to a hasty conclusion. Recommendation: Pass

STEVE COMMENTS :  Not a pre-buy.  The story has interesting moments, I agree there’s likely too many characters, some of the scenes are very well written, I like the tragic elements, just nothing spectacular. 


SUMMARY:
Part 1, ‘The Children,’ tracks a day in the life of seven children. 
TRISH and KATINA, 15, are best friends; a pair of rebels. they smoke, drink, and taunt peers at school, but their free-wheeling ways hit a snag when they are caught shoplifting and brought to the police station.  ROO, 17, Trisha’s brother, wakes up in the messy remnants of a staled, trashy party. Roo ran away from home a week prior, and seems to have lost all sense of direction. He answers an inquiry for a so-called “modeling gig,” which quickly devolves into an embarrassing, gut-wrenching porno. ORTON, 13, has also run away from his home. But he’s not by himself. His little sister, STACEY, 11, nips at his heels, refusing to leave the brother she adores on his own. The bloodstains on Stacey’s skirt – remnants of her first period – tell the story; the kids are struggling to handle things on their own. Stacey reveals to her brother with haunting candor that she’s been molested by several of their mother’s love interests. As night falls, the two fight off the cold, and find refuge in a goodwill bin, clinging to each other by candlelight.

DANIEL, 14, is at odds with his penniless mother. He storms out of the house, letting his anger out by robbing the home of elderly woman LAUREL. To his surprise, Laurel doesn’t put up a fight or even try to stop him. The old woman just seems happy to have a warm body in her house, but when she gets too close Daniel shoves her, sending her flying into a bookcase, injuring her badly. Daniel scrambles away and returns home,  anonymously tipping the cops.  Daniel runs home and finds his mother’s room empty, a bottle of sleeping pills on her nightstand.  JAMES, 30s, is an insurance broker. His job has a stranglehold on his life, until he receives news that his mother (laurel) has died. He’s called down to identify the body, where he finds GINA, (Trisha and Roo’s) mom waiting as well. The children’s stories climax with Roo walking despondently along train tracks, bright headlights flashing and a horn blaring and Daniel laying on his mother’s bed, her bottle of sleeping pills empty.

Part 2, ‘The Mothers.’
TANYA, Daniel’s mother, struggles to make mortgage payments on the house while her husband PETER offers little support. Determined to make ends meet, Tanya supplements her income as a nurse by tending to a sick man, bathing him, laying with him, comforting him in a way she doesn’t even do for her own son. 
BIANCA, Katina’s mother, is a heavy gambler. She runs into Peter at the bar, who inexplicably hands her his wife’s mortgage money, and Bianca splurges on a new dress.   Bianca’s happiness is short-lived;  a police officer returns truant Katrina to her, and the teen snippily chastises her mother’s hopeless appearance.
RHONDA, (Orton and Stacey’s mother), finally makes the decision to kick her good-for-nothing boyfriend out and sets out to make amends with her runaway children, but before she’s able to find them, she’s met with a mother’s most painful news: Her children burned to death in the goodwill bin, the fire having set ablaze from the candle.

GINA hears Rhonda’s scream. Fretting over her missing son Roo, Gina had dashed over to investigate news reports that a local teen was found dead in a river.

James sits in the coroner’s office preparing to identify his mother Laurel’s body. He came straight from her house, where a childhood flashback of an anonymous woman dropping off a package on his 13th birthday flooded back to him in a chilling memory, which leads him to the revelation that he was adopted. 
Tanya finds her son Daniel unconscious on her bed, an empty bottle of sleeping pills next to him. She and Peter rush him to the emergency room. Daniel survives, and Tanya climbs in his hospital bed, holding him in her arms like so many of her patients.

TITLE: Bran Nue Dae
DIRECTOR: Rachel Perkins
WRITER: Rachel Perkins
CAST:  TBA

READER: Joey DePaolo
SUBMITTED BY: Stephen Kelliher
GENRE: Romance/Musical

LOGLINE:
Aboriginal boy Willie walks out on his oppressive religious boarding school to pursue life, adventure, and the girl he loves.

COMMENTS:
Bran Nue Dae is a playful, surreal, at times ridiculous adventure. At its heart, the story possesses sobering messages about racism, religion, and Aboriginal place in Australian society packed into neatly woven musical numbers, but the cast is flimsy and one-dimensional,  and the script loses steam at the end. After building a great amount of anticipation for the finale in Broome, the story ends Bran Nue Dae out with a peep. The impending hurdles for Willie – his condemning mother, disappointed Rosie, and the furious priest who found out about all of Willie’s transgressions along the way – resolve in a way that feels more like a glorified soap opera sweeps week finale.

STEVE COMMENTS : Very bizarre, but at least I can’t fault it for being unoriginal.   I agree that the climax is weak, but wasn’t really thinking it would work even earlier.  IF the music is lots of fun, this could be a treacly surprise, but its no prebuy.


SUMMARY:

Australian Aborigine WILLIE is an honest, honorable young man, rigidly loyal to his exceedingly religious mother THERESA in the tropical town of Broome. He’s devoted to her and her happiness, perhaps to a fault. It certainly stifles his affection for ROSIE, who seems to be waiting for a clear sign of Willie’s interest in her. Problem is, Willie is being groomed by his mother to become a priest, and fraternization with the opposite sex is strictly forbidden.

Willie rebels a bit, but just as he and Rosie start to get close, he’s forced to go away to the Clontarf religious boarding school for the summer.  Clontarf’s head FATHER BENEDICTUS takes Willie under his wing. He names Willie a prefect, and puts him on a fast track to follow in his footsteps. 

After joining in on a boys’ scandalous late night pillaging of snacks from the academy’s candy shop, Willie goes before the church and confesses his guilt. Father Benedictus is deeply perturbed, but rather than accept his punishment, Willie takes a stand against the priest, mocks the congregation and scampers away, leaving his previous life behind him.

A long train ride brings Willie off his cloud and back down to his harsh reality: he is without a place to go. He comes across a circle of local drifters, led by the notably lewd hobo TADPOLE. Willie recounts his story of the Clontarf and Father Benedictus, adding he’s trying to return to Broome to make things right. Tadpole tells Willie that he himself left Broome nearly twenty years. He volunteers to accompany him back, but after procuring the last of Willie’s money, Tadpole hightails it over to a pub and wastes away his money on booze instead. Willie is heartbroken and breaks down in tears on the curb. Overcome, Tadpole finally comes around and agrees to head off with him.

Putting his street cunning to action, Tadpole sets on devising a costless way to trek the 2000 miles to Broome. In an instant, Tadpole hops under the Kombi van of a hippie couple. Despite a less-than-stellar performance, his feigned injury is convincing enough to the hippies, SLIPPERY and ANNIE, who in turn agree to help Willie and the wounded Aborigine back home.

Meanwhile, Father Benedictus comes across the same drifters in the park. Using a bribe of candy bars, he finds out about Willie’s planned trip back to Broome. 

Out on the road, Slippery’s patience with the obnoxious Tadpole quickly wears thin, and he drives off with Annie, leaving Willie and Tadpole behind. But karma isn’t far behind, as the van stalls out before they can even drive out of the vicinity. While Tadpole lends a hand fixing the van up, a truck hauling a football team pulls up and offers Willie a ride. Willie accepts without reluctance, sending Tadpole a curt farewell in the process.

Willie finds nothing but trouble at the truck’s next stop. He’s accosted by a floozy and beaten up by her boyfriend, only to be saved by the van’s timely arrival and Tadpole’s effective right hook.

The gang heads back out together again, but are quickly back in trouble’s way. Caught smoking pot by the highway patrol, the four spend the night in a jail cell, where Willie finds out Slippery’s real identity is none other than Wolfgang Benedictus – Father Benedictus’s son.

After their release, the four make a triumphant arrival in Broome, where Willie finally musters the ability to offer his true feelings to Rosie – just what she’d been waiting to hear. The two run off to the beach together, where the church’s congregation is leading an open prayer on the beach, and to Willie’s bewilderment, he witnesses his mother confess to giving birth to child out of wedlock. Benedictus makes his arrival, and to great shock, admits that this child, Slippery, is his son. Tadpole follows suit in confession, announcing to the group that he walked out on his cheating wife nearly twenty years ago. Theresa breaks down, and admits it was she, and returns serve with yet another bombshell – Willie is Tadpole’s son.
We close on the new enlarged family piling into the old Kombi van, heading toward Lombadina, the town where Tadpole first met Theresa.

Bringing Up Bobby is the story of a European con-artist, Olive, and her 8 year old American born son, Bobby, who find themselves in Oklahoma in an effort to escape her past and build a better future. Olive and Bobby blithely charm their way from one adventure to another until Olive's criminal past catches up with her. Consequently, she must make a choice: move on and continue with a life of crime or let go of the person she loves most in an effort to give Bobby a proper chance in life.

COMMENTS
A well written script with strong dialogues which I really enjoyed reading. An intriguing character piece as the relationship between mother and son is unusual and very passionate. The story has a some ‘fuck the system’ elements in it and it reminds me in a way of  THELMA AND LOUISE, also, it has a good sense of black humor. However, the budget is rather low and Famke a first time director who only has 20 shooting days, this might be a risk. But I can definitely see Milla Jovovich as Olive and therefore this film is a potential crossover arthouse project, but not very commercial.


SUMMARY
The story is set in Oklahoma where we are introduced to Olive, a 40 year old European woman, and her 8 year old American son, Bobby. Olive and Bobby appear to be taking a car for a test drive. But when the car dealer leaves to draw up the paper work, Olive and her son steal the car and speed off into the sunset. We follow Olive and Bobby as they try to set up shop in Oklahoma with the help of her old friend, Walt. We find out that Olive and Bobby move around a lot and that she is clearly on the run from a past she would like to escape. Olive’s main goal in life, however, is to make sure that her son, Bobby, will have opportunities she never had. She enrolls him in school, makes him do his homework and tries her hardest to be a good mother. 

But regardless of her efforts, Bobby is getting in trouble at school, he makes prank calls and he displays other behavior in keeping with being raised by a con-artist. After a successful night of conning, where Olive and Walt attend a church group fundraiser for Bowling For the Lord, they walk away with a ton of money. They claim they are doing research for their own fundraiser for Cycling Around With Little Baby Jesus.

The next morning Olive is ready to celebrate her success with Bobby. While Olive is making celebratory pancakes for her son, Bobby takes his skateboard out and gets hit by a car. Olive and Kent, the man driving the car, rush Bobby to the hospital. Bobby survives with little more than a broken leg. Kent and his wife Mary, we find out, have lost a child of their own and feel extremely responsible for the accident. Olive’s ultimate downfall happens when she tries to scam the insurance company by claiming that Bobby’s injuries far exceed his broken leg. With the help of her religious neighbor, who feels that Olive and Bobby bring down the neighborhood, Olive ultimately gets arrested. 

With no family of her own and nobody she can trust, Olive turns to Mary and Kent to take care of her son while she spends time in jail. The only way that Mary and Kent can look after Bobby is by temporarily adopting Bobby. Olive agrees since this is the only way she can keep Bobby out of foster care. 

When Olive comes out of prison after eight months, Bobby’s life has changed tremendously. He is doing well in school, he has formed a close bond with Mary and Kent and he has become accustomed to a life filled with stability, love and luxury. Olive is forced to move in with Walt, who is living in a tiny trailer with his moronic girlfriend, Darlene. Olive is determined to get Bobby back and live a life without crime. But Olive has no other skills than conning and is forced to take jobs like cleaning toilets. Mary offers Olive to move in with them while she is getting her life back on track. Mary feels that it is the least they can do after Olive has given them the gift of a lifetime: the ability to love again.

Bobby is now caught between two worlds and the stability that had done him a world of good is now shattered. Bobby begins acting out again. After a series of events, which include Olive being accused of stealing when she returns Mary’s clothing and Bobby ending up at the police station after making a prank call to 911 claiming there was a man with a gun at his school which turns into a Columbine type of experience, Olive makes the decision to temporarily leave Bobby with Mary and Kent in order to give her son a chance at a better life until she gets her own life together.

A morally complex story about age, loyalty and betrayal between two strong women, a famous writer and her ageless housekeeper.

Comments:  
An intriguing character piece, as the relationship between the writer and housekeeper is wretched and fascinating at the same time.  It’s a cat fight all the way to the finish between these two stubborn women.  Great dialogue and back and forth banter. It’s somewhat reminiscent of the relationship between Judi Dench and Cate Blanchett in NOTES ON A SCANDAL.  The story has a bit of a REAR WINDOW feel, voyeuristic and meddlesome.  The use of strange montages throughout the story will add an intriguing aesthetic to the screen.  It has potential for festival praise if Mirren plays her part well, but may have difficulty finding an audience.  Not commercial.  How many people are interested in seeing two old women have at it?  It’s primarily for a female audience. Not a strong pre-buy but worth considering further.

Summary:  
MAGDA is a famous writer and wife to TIBOR.  They are an older couple who live quite a comfortable life in their large villa in a small country town.  The rain pours down.  We learn right away what Magda has done.  She has killed EMERIC, their rough and tough housekeeper, who lives in a flat across the street. 

We cut back to a nice summer day, months earlier.  Emeric, an older woman, but still very strong and tall, works outside.  She’s a soldier in an apron, tending to her garden.  Magda pays her a visit one morning to ask if she will assist them with housekeeping at the villa.  Magda and Tibor are new to the neighborhood and could use the help, as Tibor is older and needs a lot of attention, and Magda just doesn’t have the time as she’s busy finishing up her next novel.  Emeric does not seem interested, she won’t just wash anyone’s clothes.  But to Magda’s surprise, she shows up for work the next day.   

Emeric starts to show up at unusual times.  She’ll come into the house late at night and do some cleaning and the dishes.  Quite strange, but Magda and Tibor accept it.  We start to learn from the neighbors that Emeric never lets anyone into her home and her door is always locked.

The more time Emeric and Magda spend with each other, the more we realize Emeric is a miserable woman.  She disapproves of everything Magda does, and has no problem letting her know it.  No “pleases” and no “thank yous.”  This really starts to irritate Magda, but she continues to kill Emeric with kindess.  But one thing she can’t discount Emeric for is being loyal.  She does her job well, and as long as Tibor is happy, then Emeric stays.

Little by little, Magda learns more about Emeric’s quarks, her unhealthy obsession with cats, as an obvious means for companionship.  

Magda meets the local colonel who tells her a bit about Emeric’s past.  She was charged with killing Jews and robbing them during the war, for being a spy for Americans and attempting to overthrow democracy.  Some of these accusations may have been a bit exaggerated.  

Back at the villa, Magda tries to work on her novel, but spends most of her time staring down at Emeric, watching her every move.  The next day Magda invites Emeric to church and she impolitely declines.  Meanwhile, Tibor is starting to feel ill.

Magda’s novel is published and Emeric gives her a hard time about the bad reviews that were in the papers.  Emeric tells her that her writing is shit.  This infuriates Magda.  Meanwhile, Tibor becomes more ill and must go to the hospital. Emeric helps them through the difficult time, in her weird sort of ways.  Slowly, Emeric starts to reveal more to Magda about her life.  It’s obvious that Emeric doesn’t find it easy to trust people, so the little that she gives to Magda is to be cherished.   

Emeric asks Magda if she can meet with a guest at her house, instead of meeting at her villa.  A bit of an odd request,  but Magda agrees.  When the visitor never shows, Emeric loses it.  Her temper flares and we sense she’s dealt with abandonment before.  Magda continues to question her about her strange behavior.  Why does she lock everyone out of her home? Why is she so miserable?

Emeric takes it upon herself to rearrange the decorations in their home, and display some strange and interesting pieces, like a ceramic dog.  This drives Magda nutty.  Magda tries to get rid of Emeric, but soon realizes that she cannot take care of sick Tibor alone, and continue her writing career.  So reluctantly, she asks for Emeric’s help.

We soon learn a little more about Emeric’s past, that her grandfather, with whom she lived, disapproved of the child she had out of wedlock when she was younger.  Her grandfather would beat her constantly.  It becomes obvious where Emeric gets her behavior.  She had to ask her grandfather to take care of the child until the war was over.  Later, Emeric watches as her own child is killed.  Things become a lot more clear to Magda now.

Emeric starts to get a cough, that worsens over time.  She takes a leave of absence from housekeeping.  After a few days, Magda checks on her, but realizes that her condition has gotten worse.  Emeric asks Magda to dispose of one of her cats who has died.  Instead of burying it in the backyard, she tosses it in the dumpster.  Shortly after, Magda takes off for a press conference for her new novel, and when she returns home, finds Magda on the floor in her flat, nearly dead.  She takes her to the hospital, and when Emeric regains consciousness, asks Magda not to let anyone into her flat, and to keep the door locked.  

Magda, not realizing the what she’s about to do is a huge act of betrayal, goes back to Emeric’s flat to clean it out.  She lets some of the neighbors in to help, and what they discover is an apartment filled with filth and waste, and an unhealthy number of cats crawling about, one room is so unkept and hasn’t been touched for years, that at the sheer presence of people, everything in the room turns to dust (wood worm).  Her secret has now been revealed to the entire town.

COMMENTS
Talented actors with juicy roles, I liked this script far more than I thought I would based on the insidery Hollywood logline.  Could be interesting for arthouse, and its worth reading at the very least.  The plot is just middling, GARY floats in and out and serves as the glue holding together the otherwise loose strands of the story, and the dialog is often excessively florid.  The film, if done poorly, will be as forgettable as HOLLYWOODLAND; but I think this script is stronger, and the actors Shannon, Foster, Lewis and Clarkson are all really talented, if not big box office draws.  Arthouse only.  I didn’t love it, and it really drags at times (particularly when GARY starts philosophizing) but there’s depth and quality on the page. 

SUMMARY 
Hollywood. 1960s.  TREVOR LEWIS, a screenwriter, gets knock at the door.  Homicide Detective’s found his name in the pocket of a man named GARY CARSON and they ask Trevor his relation him.   

Trevor tells them that in order to explain his relationship with Gary, He must tell them first about SUSAN, a former model.

TWO YEARS EARLIER.  GARY fishes Susan out of a river after she tries to kill herself.  GARY meets TREVOR in the hospital.  GARY is a bit of a hustler, a draft dodger, a flirt, and above all, beautiful.  The next morning he shows up at Trevor’s and invites himself back for dinner.  The two have a meal, then go home and have sex.  Gary unpacks his suitcase, clearly eager to crash at Trevor’s for awhile. “You’re a criminal now, harboring a fugitive.” 

TREVOR and GARY visit SUSAN at her mother’s place. She tells Trevor (perhaps jokingly) that she basically tried to kill herself after finding out that she had gained four pounds in one week. 

TREVOR takes GARY to a party at a rich guy, TAUBE’s house in Beverly Hills.  Trevor’s director CLIFF arrives, as does SUSAN and the movie star JULIE FORBES.  JULIE takes a liking to Gary and promises to make him a star, but Gary insults her and she storms out.  CLIFF reprimands TREVOR; Julie is the star of their picture, and Cliff thinks GARY is ruining Trevor’s life and threatens to fire TREVOR if he doesn’t finish the script.  GARY, meanwhile, goes home with SUSAN. “Don’t make a scene.”  Gary comes back after Susan gives him LSD.  “She’s a witch!” 

The next morning, GARY has disappeared, and robbed TREVOR.  Cliff calls demanding the script.  “Is it done or almost done!”  A girl named SALLIE arrives on Trevor’s doorstep, holding a sick baby, and searching for GARY.  “I love him more than anyone!” 

TREVOR and CLIFF get fired by Julie.  Cliff laments, “your roommate should have taken her home and fucked her!”  

TREVOR hears that GARY is living in the mountains in Malibu.  He visits and finds GARY thinner, and more bitter.  He loans GARY money, but GARY is ungrateful and rude. TREVOR leaves and hears GARY crying as he walks out. 

Susan marries a reclusive millionaire.  She admits to Trevor its not a matter of love, more that they “joined forces.”   

TREVOR visits GARY on ranch in the mountains that seems to be run by some sort of cult that is headed by NEWT GODSON (a clear CHARLES MANSON referencing character). GARY seems brainwashed and tells Trevor that the ranch is the first place he’s ever felt young and at home.  Trevor asks him to return to his house, but Gary refuses. “It was the last time I saw him.” 

CURRENT – The cops tell Trevor that GARY and the other cult members broke into Susan’s house and killed her. 

Years later – Trevor, now living in debauchery, attending orgies, seemingly living an aimless life, starts writing a story about the ordeal.

COMMENTS:
The story idea is original, but very abstract.  It feels a bit like EYES WIDE SHUT.  The subject matter of a model stand in that is used to create a replica of the missing painting in a famous series is not going to appeal to a large crowd.  There’s a lot of exposition, which takes away from the suspense.  It’s a film about an artist with a strange obsession of recording people in his home to re-create paintings.  The tone is interesting, and the pace seems to work, but the story wasn’t captivating to me.  It’s definitely different, and the cast is decent, but I would wait to see something first.  It might be something for the very arty crowd, but outside of that it will have a difficult time finding an audience.  Not an urgent pre-buy.  

SYNOPSIS: 
Two men with broken arms board a flight.  While one young man injured his arm in a snowboarding accident, the other’s story is a bit more complicated.  And he spends the next few hours of his flight, telling the story to his flight mates.  

A desperate young man tries to make money by cleaning car windshields in scuba attire.  He answers a newspaper ad, that seems to be directed at him.  He’s given instructions to show up at a house, and pose for a painting.  There are a series of empty rooms in this house, and he’s given precise instructions to lay down in a room underneath a sheet, while a camera focuses on him.  Money is left for him at the end of the job.  The anonymous artists asks him to return every Friday thereafter, and pays him 500 pounds for every half hour session, which usually requires him to get naked, and pose in some interesting position.  You start to realize this mystery artist has some sort of weird obsession, and the man for hire, known as 3A, begins to enjoy the job as well.

The COLLECTOR, who hosts a show that assesses the value of art pieces, turns out to  be the anonymous artist, who has hired 3A to replicate the missing painting in a famous series.  The two finally meet.  It almost feels as though there’s a bit of homosexual tension between the two, even though the Collector is married to a woman, who also happens to have a strange obsession, shoplifting.

3A breaks the rules the Collector has set forth, and brings a girl back to the house, to show her what he does.  They end up having sex on camera in one of the rooms.  After they are done, the cameras turn off, and we get the impression the Collector is ticked off with 3A, he feels betrayed.  

The Collector finally gets his hands on the original missing painting from the series.  The collector manages to trade the new ones he has created, for the original piece he’s been trying to get his hands on.  3A feels betrayed, he’s been traded for a painting.  He thought they had something special.  Out of anger, 3A takes a knife and slashes it through the canvas, the collector wrestles with him to save the painting, and 3A breaks his arm.  

3A feels guilty for what he’s done, and goes back to the Collector to apologize.  He follows the last set of instructions from the Collector, which is to fly to New York for a man who wants to hire him for his own use, and hand deliver the painting that he’s traded with the Collector.  And 3A continues his career as a model for painting.

Two Former Yugoslavians, a Muslim and a Christian, accidentally meet in the United States and begin a strained friendship.  

COMMENTS

The plot seems short in the summary because each scene is dialog heavy and packed with little twists and turns in the characters behavior.  The climactic scene where Hassan is forced to choose between the cash and the car builds and builds and builds, with Hassan’s race, masculinity loyalty to his wife and pragmatism are all thrown into question.  Each man comes across crazy at times, but their lives, their uprooted nature and their survival instincts drive their behavior.   A powerful, well written script… however… it is a slow read, and the points are hammered home too many times and despite the exciting conclusion, I don’t think this project is worth getting involved with at this stage.  Seems like the type of film that will rely heavily on direction and performances, and even if all those aspects are solid, will likely still feel like a festival film rather than one with commercial appeal.


SUMMARY 

HASSAN, a lapsed Muslim of Yugoslavian descent, lives in America.  His wife ANGELA, a community theater actress, hates the fact that he spends all of his time maintaining his BUICK RIVIERA.  She thinks the car is a junker and a waste of money, and wants to buy a Japanese car like everyone else.

One night, after a nasty argument, Hassan goes for a drive by himself and crashes his car into a ditch.   A good Samaritan, VUKO pulls over and picks him up.  The two men realize that they are both from Yugoslavia and begin speaking to each other in Bosnian.   Vuko gets a little too personal, telling Hassan that he has left his wife. Hassan acts coldly towards him, even threatening to get out of the car if Vuko wont stop prying.  Hassan gets upset that Vuko laughs at the Riviera and calls it junk.  Hassan angrily turns down a ride home, and Vuko leaves him.  Later, Vuko in a seemingly unrelated fit of rage destroys his own Mercedes.

Hassan realizes that he lost his wallet.  The next day Hassan gets a note from Vuko who has found the wallet and wants to meet up.  After Angela insists, Hassan reluctantly invites Vuko over for Chinese food to thank him for returning the wallet.   Vuko hits on Angela, and Hassan again acts rudely to him.  The tension in the air comes to a boil when Vuko offers Hassan five grand in cash for the Buick.  Angela is initially ecstatic, but when she sees how upset Hassan is getting, she decides to support him.   Hassan secretly cuts the breaks on the Riviera and accepts Vuko’s offer.  Vuko drives away and crashes, nearly dying.  He grabs his gun and walks back to Hassan’s house to kill him, but Hassan has already disappeared – leaving to start a new life, he hitches a ride with an Elvis Presley look alike.  Vuko gets arrested for barging into Hassan’s house with a gun.

LOGLINE

An Indian woman runs off with her seven year old daughter to save her from being forced into a marriage with a much older man.

COMMENTS

A brutally forthright script about the horrors associated with the repressed lives of females in Muslim society, – women in the film are raped, abused and one is literally stoned to death.   The fugitive plot starts off powerfully, but the chase lags and the ending left me feeling vacant rather than moved – in a film with no hope, a tragic ending is not a surprise.  The romance between Allah and Sohail had some good moments, and the imagery of the merging rivers was powerful, but again, the resolution (he drops her off at the consulate before changing his mind and rushing back a moment too late…) was disappointing.  With strong performances and direction it could be a strong festival type pic. 

SUMMARY

ALLAH RAKHI, a 25 year old woman, cooks is married to a tribal chief DAULAT KHAN, 76, who fawns over her and adores her cooking.  Allah, who already has a seven year old daughter ZAINAB with him, secretly takes birth control pills to avoid another pregnancy.  Daulat believes it is right as a husband to have his way with her sexually, even during her period, at which point he practically rapes her in the ass.

Daulat’s friend HASHIM KHAN takes a liking to young Zainab and asks to marry her.  Allah is devastated when Daulat tells her that her daughter must marry the lecherous old man (who also happens to be Zainab’s Uncle).  Upset that his wife be so insolent, he locks Allah in her room so that she can’t interfere with the wedding, only letting her out when she agrees not sabotage the wedding plans. Allah’s protestations come from her own experiences, she was forced to marry Daulat when she was also a very young girl, and still has nightmares about being raped on their wedding night. She wants her daughter to be spared the same fate.  

The wedding goes off without a hitch, but Allah manages to sneak away with Zainab, escaping after the ceremony and running for the highway.  The runaways are picked up by SOHAIL, a truck driving scamp reluctant to help.  Upon finding out the women have disappeared, Daulat and his nephew SHEBAZ (a violent man who fancies Allah Rakhi) chase after them in an armored van, armed with machine guns.  Daulat is desperate to find the women before sunrise to avoid Hashim being shamed publicly for his wife’s disappearance.  

SOHAIL realizes that they are being chased and decides to pull over and immediately turn the women over to their pursuers, realizing that they’ve put his life at risk.  Allah pulls out a gun and holds it to her head, vowing to commit suicide rather than be returned to Daulat.  Sohail reluctantly agrees to help them, and hides them in his truck.  Dolait and Shebaz pull him over at gunpoint and search the vehicle, but find nothing.  Sohail lies, telling them that he dropped the women off in a different town.  

At a truckstop, Sohail runs into his deceased wife’s brother (his former brother in law) who sees the women and reports them to the police, who in turn, alert Dolait.  Back on the road, Sohail is stopped by police, but convinces them that Allah is his wife.  

They make it to a bridge where two major rivers meet, but realize they need to cross treacherous mountains guarded by gangs, and cannot make it in their truck.  ZAINED wanders off and nearly falls through the rickety bridge over the rivers, but ABDULLAH, a wise old man, saves the child’s life.  Abdullah promises to help the fugitives by driving the truck around the mountain, and insists that the only way they can make it to the other side is to cut through the mountain. 

In the mountains they are kidnapped by the gangs, but Allah saves the warlord’s wife’s life, so the gangster allows her to pass.  On the other side of the mountain they are relieved to find that Abdullah has kept his word.  Aware that their truck has been identified, they swap it for his minivan and head to Lenore in the desperate hopes of rendezvousing with Allah’s mother TASNEEM.  Tasneem has already been approached by Dolait and she has agreed to cooperate; she agrees to meet Allah in the town square, but doublecrosses her daughter… Dolait and his men are able to nab Zained, but Solait and Allah escape.  Allah sneaks into Dolaits hideout and helps Zained escape. Solait drives the women (whom he’s fallen in love with) to the human rights consulate where he believes they will be safe.  While a lawyer briefs Allah as to her rights, her mother Tasneem shows up and asks to see Allah.  When she is let in, Tasneem shoots and kills Allah, her daughter.

LOGLINE 

Three unconnected Brooklyn cops end up at the same deadly location after traveling down vastly different career paths.

COMMENTS  (Steve)

A cop drama  echoing the dramatic elements of THE DEPARTED but lacking the deft screenwriting that helped make that film so powerful, this project has a big name cast and a strong director (TRAINING DAY, THE SHOOTER) but is hampered by a simplistic script with obvious dialog and stereotypical characterizations.  The film involves a few exciting sequences, most notably the climactic sequence where the three previously unrelated characters wind up interacting with deadly results.   Decent for popcorn because of cast and director only.

SUMMARY  (Greg)

	SAL is a middle-aged Brooklyn cop, sitting in a car talking with a criminal, who he shoots point blank in the head.  Sal takes his garbage bag full of money and leaves the scene.  TANGO rides with a couple thugs, running drugs back to the city.  They get pulled-over, Tango throwing tons of attitude around, but surprisingly the cops let them go.  EDDIE DUGAN is nearing retirement, and is a burnout whose never had much of a career and entertains thoughts of suicide from time to time.  All three of these cops are in way over their heads.     
	When Sal returns to the station his superior jokes with him about how lucky they are to have found a drug dealer they’d been investigating shot dead in his car.  Sal is conflicted about what he’s done, and even tries confessing to a priest.  Tango hides his gold chains, takes gold caps off his teeth and meets his supervisor DAN at a secluded diner.  Tango’s working undercover on a local drug dealing crew, and has been doing so for nearly 4 years, his wife divorcing him along the way.  Eddie meanwhile goes through another day of writing tickets and directing traffic; only a few weeks of his pathetic career left till he retires. 
	Sal heads home to his family, stashing the stolen drug money underneath his bed.  His wife is pregnant with twins, and he already has five daughters and two sons.  Sal has been socking stolen money away with the hopes of buying his family their dream house, so they don’t have to live all crammed together.  Tango meanwhile attends a homecoming party for CAZ, an aging drug dealer just paroled and currently on house arrest.  While working undercover in the prison, Tango befriended Caz and feels very close to him.  They laugh and joke while reminiscing, everyone having a good time in the Louis Pink Projects, where Caz’s crew sells crack cocaine.  
	With operation Clean Sweep having been approved, the Brooklyn police department starts hitting the projects hard.  Dealers get arrested; junkies are forced to take their business elsewhere.  Tango meanwhile gets called in to meet FBI SPECIAL AGENT SMITH, whose sole priority is to send Caz back to jail.  Having known that Caz has served his time and is trying to go straight, Tango refuses to cooperate.  But agent Smith produces documents detailing Tango’s undisclosed bank accounts where he’s been hiding money he’s been skimming off crimes he’s committed over the years.  Agent Smith only cares about the money if Tango refuses to play ball.  Tango is forced to wear a wire. 
	After leaving a rookie to handle a situation which ended in a student’s death, Eddie tries to take all the blame during the internal affairs investigation.  Later he vents to his 20 year-old whore CHANTEL that he’s a waste of cop and has done nothing to earn his retirement.  Eddie wants to turn his life around but knows it’s way too late.
	With the drug sweeps disrupting business, Caz contemplates moving his operation to another location.  RED – one of his younger and more dangerous associates – informs him about a deal to move 10 bricks of cocaine to some of his people from uptown; Tango’s wire capturing every bit of their conversation.  They head to a strip club game room to do some gambling and to meet Red’s people.  Before Caz speaks with them, Tango pulls him aside near a large speaker, whispering while surreptitiously covering the wire.  He tells Caz about a legit business opportunity running a club, giving him a business card.  Caz is dumbfounded by the offer, and later in the car ride home a drunken Tango tells Caz he wanted to be a cop when he was a kid.  Caz has to put Tango to bed he’s so wasted, and when Tango throws up on himself Caz has to remove his shirt, seeing the wire.  The next day Tango learns that Caz decided to buy the club, passing on the drug deal.  As they talk about it Caz doesn’t let his friend know he’s seen the wire, and as they’re about to part ways forever gunshots ring out.  Caz is shot to death.  All Tango can do is watch his friend die.
 	Tango is immediately brought in to meet Dan and Agent Smith, where he learns that the FBI knew Red was about to hit Caz for backing out of the drug deal he’d set up.  Despite Tango’s anger, Smith ends his undercover life right then and there, Dan telling him after the sees the psych doc for a few weeks he’ll report to the station as Detective Clarence Butler (his real name).  Tango is being given his life back but all he wants to do is settle the score with Red. 
	 After Eddie’s retirement ceremony – which he views as a farce – he goes to see Chantel, asking her to come live with him at his Connecticut lake house.  She wouldn’t have to have sex with him; Eddie just wants to give her a way out of the life she has.  Chantel declines, and as Eddie exits the rundown building he spots a young girl being put into a van whom he recognizes as having been reported missing.  Sal meanwhile has been trying to get the last of the money for the down payment on his family’s dream house.  He’s missed a few opportunities to steal drug money, and now feeling like he won’t be able to get the funds he needs in time, decides to get himself killed in the line of duty so his family can collect the insurance.  While on a stakeout at the projects with rookie cop RONNY, Sal sends him to get food, and heads to a known drug dealer’s apartment, passing Tango, who’s looking for Red with a loaded .45 desert eagle.  Eddie meanwhile has followed the girl in the van to the same building.  Tango enters Red’s apartment and puts the gun to his head but can’t pull the trigger, deciding to arrest him instead.  And Sal is praying before kicking in the drug dealer’s door, getting scared about walking into certain death.  
	Eddie enters an apartment, finding the missing girl and two others chained to a radiator.  Red meanwhile pleads with Tango, who gets so enraged after not being able to call in for assistance because his name has been erased, shoots Red dead on the street.  But Ronny – the rookie Sal sent for food – witnesses this and shoots Tango dead.  Eddie is able to save the girls, and when Sal enters the apartment the drug dealers surrender to him.  Sal happens upon a million dollars in the closet, but as he’s gathering it up another drug dealer shows up and kills him.  
	The next day’s paper is littered with headlines and pictures of Eddie, Sal and Tango with the words “Brooklyn’s Finest” above them.  With the insurance money Sal’s family moves into their dream house, Tango is remembered by Caz, and Eddie heads to his lake house, putting his “Outstanding Valor by a Citizen” award on his mantle before going fishing.

TITLE: Against All Enemies
DIRECTOR:  Robert Redford
WRITER: James Vanderbilt
CAST: Bruce Willis
STATUS: Shooting first quarter of 08
GENRE: Political Thriller
READER: Steven Murphy

LOGLINE

Based on the memoirs of fallen “terrorism czar” Richard Clarke who’s outspoken warnings about the threat of AL QAEDA came years before 9-11, and who’s subsequent testimonies have made him a pariah.

COMMENTS

Richard Clarke’s story is a modern day American tragedy and his point of view of the “war on terror” and the U.S’s terrible handling of the growing threat of Al Qaeda is intelligent, gripping and completely unique (because of the unprecedented insider knowledge of the events that he provides).  Watching the history of the conflict grow from the late seventies mujahadin to the eventual culmination of 9-11 and the subsequent misguided invasion of Iraq feels like a TOM CLANCY book set in the real world, giving the action an intense gravity.  For an international audience, this could very well be too American… but in it’s favor – on the page it doesn’t feel like a stereotypical Hollywoodization of the events; and the point of view is very insider, very honest and very implicative of the US government.  The script is aided by strong dialog, peppered with some moments of gallows humor, as well as smartly written portrayals of real life characters. The story is much more linear than the work of Stephen Gaghan or other flashier “Political Thrillers,” but I felt the stylistic restraint works in its favor.


SUMMARY

The film opens with RICHARD CLARKE in crisis mode – September 11th, 2001 and the US is under the largest homeland attack in its history.  Staying calm and collected under pressure, Clarke risks his life by staying in the white house and coordinating a “continuance of government” despite the implicit knowledge that the white house is a primary target of the attack.

Flashback – 1979 – The U.S. through state department up and comer Clarke, supplies arms to the mujahadin fighters of Afghanistan in the hopes that their SOVIET attackers would exhaust their resources in a drawn out war.  The US plan works: in 1989, the USSR crumbles. 

Clarke’s happiness is short lived as a new enemy quickly surfaces: the former mujahadin fighters now view America as the infidel aggressors in the region.  “What is this, Muj 2: Electric Bugaloo?” Clarke fights the tide of government, battling red tape, bureaucracy, politics and territorialism from the FBI and CIA in order to investigate the jihadists.  After unearthing a buried assassination plot against the first president BUSH, Clarke succeeds in getting the attention of the Clinton administration. Meanwhile, the enemy begins to mount more and more violent and successful attacks : in 93 the world trade center is bombed; throughout the nineties several embassies are bombed in and the late nineties the USS Cole is blown up by Al-Qaeda.  Clarke has identified OSAMA BIN LADEN as a threat and convinced BILL CLINTON to fund a anti terrorism force (Clinton subsequently appoints Clarke as the “terrorism czar.”  Clarke engineers an attempted assassination of Bin Laden, but the Al-Qaeda leader escapes.  The embarrassment of the failed mission dooms Clarke – Clinton will not OK another attack.  When the younger BUSH wins the election in 2000, he demotes Clarke and ignores any warnings about Al-Qaeda, seeking instead to look for terrorism within IRAQ.  Even after September 11th, the administration makes it clear that they are not interested in finding BIN LADEN, so much as they are interested in justifying an attack on SADAM HUSSEIN.  Clarke resigns.  He realizes that the government is lying to the American public and decides to write a tell all book implicating the government’s refusal to pursue Al Qaeda.  He testifies before a Senate investigatory commission and apologizes to the American public for the attacks and for the failure of the US government.

LOGLINE

Three total strangers are stuck in an elevator, each of desperately needs to get out as soon as possible, for their own unique, pressing reasons.  The longer they are stuck, the more frustrated they become, and one of them eventually reveals his violent, sadistic nature.

COMMENTS

At first glance, the premise seems contrived, and the plot summary doesn’t make this script sound amazing, but I was impressed by the writing and captivated throughout.  It’s short, and the economy serves it well, with nearly every thread paying off.  I particularly like the way the story played with our perception, making Tommy at first seem like a punk, and having Karl’s sadism get revealed rather slowly.  The twist at the end that reveals the boy had engineered the tragedy is actually more chilling than the summary indicates.  

Consider.


SUMMARY

KARL is a rich doctor with a smart, cute daughter whom he adores.  CLAUDIA, a young woman, runs out of a hospital, distraught, with blood on her shirt.  TOMMY, a young punk, quietly walks out of a disheveled bedroom, leaving behind a bruised and beaten girl on the bed, and money on the nightstand.

Tommy, Claudia and Karl, total strangers, all make their way into the same building and get into the same elevator.  On the way up, it gets stuck.  They realize that they are stranded – the building is in a beach neighborhood, and all the other residents are gone for the weekend.  Almost immediately, they begin to get on each other’s nerves, especially the two men.

CLAUDIA’s FLASHBACK – Claudia and her abuela live in the building together.  ABUELA is a fun loving old woman who thinks that Claudia is too uptight “you have to break, not bend…” and urges her granddaughter to have more fun with her life.  Claudia agrees to go to the beach with her grandmother, but still refuses to let Abuela have a cigarette.  On the way to the beach, Abuela gets hit by an SUV that swerves to  avoid hitting a little boy who had run into traffic.

TOMMY’S FLASHBACK -  Tommy is madly in love with his girlfriend FRANCESCA, but is forced to live in fear of her father, a mean gambling drunk who beats her.

In the elevator, Tommy begins to panic and starts banging on the door.  Karl snaps and hits the younger man.

KARL’S FLASHBACK – Karl hits on a drunk girl at a bar and convinces her to come home with him.

Tommy, desperate to get to his apartment, climbs out of the elevator and up the rope pulley.  The pulley snaps and Tommy breaks his legs.  The elevator plummets several floors, before precariously coming to a stop, dangling only by the chinsy emergency breaks.

TOMMY’S FLASHBACK – Francesca comes crying to Tommy after being beaten by her father.  Tommy convinces her to run to Paris with him, and promises to return immediately after he grabs some cash from his house- they plan to meet at the airport, in order to escape before her father finds out.

CLAUDIA’S FLASHBACK – Abuela, dying in the hospital, asks Claudia to go back to their apartment and fetch a photo of her dead husband (Claudia’s abuelo).  Claudia rushes home (still covered in blood) in an attempt to return with the photo before her grandmother dies.

KARL’S FLASHBACK – Karl ties up the drunk girl in his apartment, drugs her, cuts her body open with a scalpel and rapes her.  

Karl needs to get out of the elevator to clean up the dead body before his daughter arrives for the weekend, Claudia is desperate to get the photo of her grandfather, and Tommy knows that his lover is waiting, terrified and alone, at the airport.  

Karl’s true nature begins to reveal itself.  With Tommy injured badly, and Claudia breaking out into asthma attacks, the sadistic Karl asserts his dominance and forces Claudia to climb out of the elevator in an attempt to free them.  She tries to set off the fire alarm to draw attention, but falls and nearly sends the elevator plunging to the ground.  When she gets back in the elevator, there is a struggle, and Karl stabs Tommy in the throat, immediately killing him.  Karl stabs Claudia, “most bitches don’t make me hard…” but she manages to pull the knife out, stab him back and escape from the elevator just before it plunges to the ground, killing Karl.

EPILOGUE - The young boy who had ran into traffic and caused Abuela’s death, had sabotaged the elevator and watched a cc monitor heartlessly as Tommy and Karl were killed.

LOGLINE

Nora is a dynamic New Yorker with a terrific job and close friends, but little romantic luck.  When pressure from family and wedded friends is about to push her to the edge, a chance meeting with a mysterious Frenchman, Julien, makes her rethink her cynical outlook on love.  Nora throws caution to the wind and heads to Paris in a last ditch attempt at real romance.

COMMENTS

Parker Posey is an often remarkable actress, who’s never really exploded with wide audiences.  I like this role for her, but the script is a mere trifle, a “chick flick” geared towards indie audiences. Billed as the next “lost in translation” the story has some charming moments, and Nora is loveably neurotic, but I don’t think this is a prebuy. 

SUMMARY

NORA, an attractive, single girl in her thirties attends an anniversary party for AUDREY and MARK ANDREWS.  Nora’s mother VIVIEN bitingly remarks that she wishes Nora had married Mark.  “You don’t want to be alone forever.”  Nora tries to mingle with the other party guests, but strikes out – only meeting a lecherous married man, and a lesbian.  Discouraged, she returns home and peruses the online personals, but her search leads to nothing “your search is too specific.”

Nora works as a customer relations concierge in a hip NYC hotel who handles V.I.Ps. She meets NICK, a famous actor, and he asks her out.   They go out on a date, Nora gets wasted, and despite Audrey’s advice, winds up sleeping with him.  Nora excitedly tells her mother that Nick is her new boyfriend, and gets depressed when the actor checks out and disappears.   On TV, Nora sees an entertainment news show that announces that Nick is dating the costar of his movie.  

Nora’s mother sets her up on a blind date that goes terribly.  Her date and actually runs into, and gets in a big fight with, his ex.  Audrey, meanwhile, is getting fed up with married life and says that she thinks her marriage to Mark is “crap.”  

Nora meets JULIEN, a frenchman, in town on business.  Julien is very frank and forward, hitting on her and trying to kiss her.  They wind up back at her house, and he sleeps over but doesn’t sleep with her.  The next day, she is slightly annoyed that he is still around, but the two of them hang out and spend the entire day together.  They wind up having passionate sex that night.  

The next day, while out at a café, she has a panic attack.  When she wakes up, Julien is gone, and Nora thinks that it is over, but he returns the next morning. He tells her that he has to return to Paris, but asks her to drop everything and come with him.  She turns him down.

3 weeks later – Nora is completely unhappy and winds up quitting her job.   She decides to go to Paris and find Julien.  Audrey accompanies her. Nora has lost Julien’s number and winds up aimlessly wandering around the streets.  Mark calls Audrey and tells her that he wants to work things out.  She goes home, unhappy to be leaving Nora in France.  On the very day that she is set to return to New York, Nora runs into Julien.  They go to a bar, and reacquaint. He is surprised to see her.  “You are going to miss your plane.”  He tells her.  “I know,” she replies.

COMMENTS
This action/adventure story could trade on the recent popularity of vampire-themed films and television, but it lacks the strong emotional appeal to attract a wide American teen audience. In international markets, could perform favorably due to its strong action and sex (specifically lesbian sex) appeal, though it's hobbled by a mediocre story that doesn't breathe too much new life into the vampire genre. Yes, concepts like 'love' and 'unrequited love' are used frequently, but here they come off as more plot device than genuine human experience. Ultimately the script doesn't delve much deeper than the superficial, but it could make for a beautifully shot art house film attractive to those viewers who aren't overly concerned with emotional subtext.
 
SUMMARY
 We meet a group of attractive female vampires on an international plane, having just killed its entire crew and passengers. LOUISE, their leader, is stoic in the face of the bloodbath, while a more youthful NORA rocks her head to pop music and the silent-movie-star throwback CHARLOTTE tries to finish a novel. Meanwhile, LENA, a resourceful, punkish 20-year-old, attempts to mug a Russian man to help pay off her corrupt Parole Officer. She's caught in the act by an attractive undercover cop, TOM, though she's able to shake him. It's clear that the two have romantically connected over the chase.
 
Lena slips out to steal more money at a hip nightclub, though her 'victim' turns out to be Louise, who has spotted something different about Lena. Louise attacks Lena's neck with a bite, though she lets her stumble home. Lena finds herself feeling sick, and craving blood... so she soon returns to the nightclub to find out what's happened to her. Louise explains Lena was already a vampire, and she just awoke her talents. Louise involves Lena in a violent scene at a Russian brothel, where Lena sustains a gunshot wound. The women make short work of the pimps, though one witness manages to escape unnoticed. Tom and his older partner, LUMMER, analyze the crime scene. Louise shows Lena how her new body will naturally heal itself. On the other hand, Lena is now reliant on the bags of blood that Louise and the girls use for sustenance.
 
Lena soon realizes the other benefits of her situation, as Louise gives her a fancy car, and takes her on an elaborate nighttime shopping spree, then to a fancy restaurant. After such a wonderful night, the women return to their hotel, where they must retreat from the sunlight. Louise finally acts on her sexual attraction by attempting to kiss Lena, though Lena rebuffs her.
 
Tom is able to track down Lena through her mug shot, and he meets her at her house while Lena is collecting her things. A jealous Louise watches as Lena and Tom connect over coffee, and Lena expresses her disappointment that she can't be with Tom.
 
Louise takes Lena to a spa where she can experience artificial sunlight, but Lena's faith in the women is shaken when they kill innocent security guards. Tom, tying the Russian brothel scene to the women, storms the hotel with a full SWAT team, which results in an eruption of gunfire and a car chase. Nora is a casualty in this battle--Lena and Charlotte watch as Louise abandons Nora to burn up in the sun light--while they narrowly escape on a subway car. 
 
Regrouping and preparing for a life on the run, Louise questions Lena's loyalty to Tom and the group. Before they depart, Charlotte visits her daughter in a nursing home, who--since she ages at a normal rate--is now sick and old. Charlotte, touched, decides to lock Louise inside a stairwell while she faces the sunlight to burn up.
 
Lena steals away from Louise in order to say goodbye to Tom. By allowing him to see her shoot herself and heal, Lena reveals that she's a vampire. A SWAT team, having been called by Lummer, bursts onto the scene, and drags them both to jail. Louise traces Lena to the police station, leaving a trail of dead officers behind her. Louise tells Lena she must choose between her and a lifetime of loneliness, before disappearing with Tom. Lummer, seeing her determination, allows Lena out of jail to save Tom.
 
In the final showdown at Teufelsberg (a radar station atop the Berlin Wall), Louise offers to spare Tom if Lena will express her undying love for her, though Lena is ultimately unconvincing. Louise fires a series of shots into Tom. Lena is successful in tackling Louise outside into the sunlight, where Louise--overcome by her love of Lena--has a change of heart. As Louise burns up, using her body to protect Lena's own, she reveals that Lena is not alone--that Tom is also a vampire--before pushing Lena to safety. Lena, however, is unable to bite Tom in order to awake the vampire inside of him, choosing instead to give him a passionate kiss before fleeing in time to escape the police. Thus, Lena chooses a lifetime of solitude rather than forcing the man she loves to join her as a vampire.

COMMENTS 

Unfortunately I don’t know the director, and there’s no cast info available yet, but for indie circle I say that this is one to at least get on your radar and start to track; if not necessarily prebuy.   The script is unique and stands apart from the other stuff I’ve read; I’ll stop short of comparing it to THE VANISHING; but there are certain similarities, and I was genuinely shocked, spooked and surprised at various points throughout the script; and though the final twist seemed a bit of a let down, and the lead villain’s craziness seemed a bit over the top, the other details were quite powerful, real, and, in deed thrilling. Worth reading, tracking, following. 

SUMMARY 

BENOIT is driving home late at night; his wife is worried and warns him to drive safely.  Benoit sees a woman, LYDIA, stalled by the side of the road and pulls over to help. He drives her home and she invites him inside, offering him a drink.  Moments later, he is woozy, spinning, and she locks him in her basement. 

Benoit, at first, thinks she is extremely kinky and that he’s being seduced, but realizes pretty quickly that he’s caged; she’s playing a game. It’s called, “watching you die…”

Cops, led by FABRE, begin investigating the disappearance of a man called GARNIER; (is it Benoit??) and they meet with his wife GAELLE, who describes their relationship as “hunky dory.” 

Fabre interviews a nosy neighbor; MS. GUICHARD; who tells them that she’d seen a red head staking out the Garnier’s house. 

The cops find a little black book of Benoits, and interview one of the entries, who tells them that she’d slept with Benoit one time. “He never called again.” 

Lydia insists that she’s holding Benoit there so that he can confess; unburden his conscience.  He keeps demanding food, but she will not; until he admits what he’s done. He maintains that he has no idea what she’s talking about. 

Benoit gets more and more alarmed as Lydia seems to come even further unhinged. She uses his credit cards to buy a welding torch and fires it at him through the bars of the cage.  He hears her return upstairs and repeatedly listen to “I wanna be your dog.” 

Benoit admits to her that he cheats on his wife, which seems to enrage Lydia even more; she asks him to tell her about the “dead one” but he claims to have no idea what she’s talking about.  He hears Lydia arguing with someone else upstairs.  She pulls a gun on him and pulls off her panties; insisting he stare at her crotch and “see Aurelia!” 

She keeps him locked up until New Year’s; he’s damn near starved and wolf’s down the celebratory chocolate cake and champagne she gives him.  She tells him that she’s poisoned him with strichnyne; and accuses him of killing her twin sister Aurelia.  Her voice she’s been making upstairs is Aurelia’s voice… there was never anyone else there.  “Confess and I’ll give you the antidote.”  Benoit; writhing in pain, admits to strangling her and burying her in the forest.  

Benoit plans to attack Lydia with a plumbing rod; but she cottons on to his plan and glues the rod in place; foiling his plan. 

She takes him to the woods to find the grave; he stumbles upon a grave and she makes him start digging… he tries to get away but she shoots him in the leg.  She takes him back to the cage; he finds out her sister was killed on January 4th; a day he has an alibi for… he proves it by sending her to his house to find a file that proves his innocence. Lydia believes him, but still doesn’t let him go; fearful she will be arrested. 

Lydia is seemingly about to let him go, but she gets electrocuted and dies. A mysterious figure comes into the basement wearing a plastic mask; Benoit screams for help but the figure ignores his pleas. Benoit comes to a horrible realization, “you’re the one who has been manipulating her!” 

The figure starts cleaning out Lydia’s extensive files from her house;  Benoit is left to die… a friend of Lydia comes over; worried; but he is too late to save Benoit.  The killer turns out to be Lydia’s shrink; avenging Benoit for seducing and “discarding” her daughter.

It was mildly interesting but ultimately rather uninspiring. Most of the pieces felt too forced to truly work in a theatrical manner. Fans of the book might have a desire to see how it is adapted but since it rehashes many of the arguments in the book, it doesn't delve into much new material. The directors should have a draw with doc audiences but their work is not signature enough or compelling enough to sustain for a feature length piece. Many of the topics are also very American centric and I would find that it might be difficult for foreign audiences to connect with an economic argument about these topics (for example...if black names hurt a child's overall prospects in life vs a white name). If any of your clients are fans of the book or if their territory has a major publisher who has sold a lot of copies of the book, it may work, other than that, there should be other more compelling (and commercial) docs in the marketplace for international buyers.

On the eve of their 25th anniversary season, the members of a world- renowned string quartet struggle to stay together in the face of death, competing egos, and insuppressible lust.  

COMMENTS - SW
First off, I found this script to be a bit tedious and whole-heartedly pretentious.  It just takes itself and the whole world of concert-level musicians a too seriously.  The whole story to me feels somewhat formulaic and contrived.  As they are a quartet and everyone somehow is intertwined or related, the whole thing is quite incestuous.   I think this is supposed to be part of its charm and intrigue.  For me it was all somewhat boring.  I understand that this is being made for an international, high-brow, upscale audience yet I am not at all confident that the level of cast in this film will take this project to that level.  Also, I think that the actors cast are not necessarily going to draw out the audience that I would imagine would go to see this film, aside from Christopher Plummer.  The director is going to have to elicit some compelling performances to make this a real contender, otherwise I fear it could come off as a high-end TV movie.  Writer/director Zilberman so far has an award-winning documentary in his list of director credits and received a medal for that one from the French Parliment.  I definitely do not see this as a pre-buy - would definitely wait to see some footage.  Also, the budget on this is $6.3M which feels a little high.


SYNOPSIS: 
When the patriarchal cellist of the world-renowned Fugue String Quartet, Peter Mitchell (Christopher Plummer) is diagnosed with early stages of Parkinson’s disease, the group’s future suddenly hangs in the balance: the competing egos of first violinist, Daniel Lerner (Guy Pearce), and second violinist, Robert Gerlbart (Ewan McGregor), erupt over who will hold first chair; the marriage of Robert and violist Juliette (Catherine Keener) is jeopardized by Robert’s one-night, extra-marital affair; and Robert and Juliette’s daughter, Alexandra, successfully seduces the enigmatic Daniel. As the quartet’s 25th anniversary concert looms, possibly becoming their last, only the power of music and the 
bond between the members can preserve their legacy. 

DIRECTOR'S STATEMENT
I first came up with the idea for A Late Quartet several years ago, while traveling in Europe with Watermarks, the film that I had just completed. I wanted my next film to have a strong dramatic arch. As an avid fan of chamber music ever since my teens, I suddenly realized that the dynamic of a string quartet would be the ideal setting for this. becoming an established string quartet involves years of intimate, intense rehearsals and performances, punctuated by frequent arguments over every note and every sentiment. While each individual has the potential to star as a soloist, what makes them a successful quartet is their ability to endow their music with a unified voice, despite their individual differences. To quote Arnold Steinhardt of the Guarneri String Quartet: 

“ Four people let their individual personalities shine while finding a unified voice… endless musings, discussions, criticism that… end up as an interpretation.”

A Late Quartet is structured around Beethoven’s groundbreaking and favorite quartet, String Quartet No. 14 in C sharp minor (opus 131), considered by many quartet musicians to be the Holy Grail of quartet compositions. Upon hearing opus 131 Schubert asked, “What else is there to write?” Beethoven indicated that although the piece is almost 45 minutes long, it should be played without a pause between its seven movements (the standard was four). When playing a piece that long without a break, the instruments are bound to go out of tune, each in a completely different way. This is a perfect metaphor for long-term relationships, with their constant need for readjustment and fine-tuning because of the ways that people inevitably change over long periods of time.  


The script for A Late Quartet is inspired by Beethoven’s opus 131 throughout. It follows the structure with its changing moods, its pace, and its length. The associations borne by each movement will inspire the artistic aspects of the filmmaking on all levels, capturing the music’s emotional rollercoaster, as it shifts from a profound and dark fugue (1st movement) into a light airy sonata (2nd movement), followed by a short operatic recitative (3rd movement), which serves as the transition into the heavenly variations-on-a-theme (4th movement). This is followed by a quick, devilish passage (5th movement), which turns into a tragic eulogy (6th movement), leading to the fast-paced, galloping musical chase and conclusion of the seventh movement. 

To prepare for A Late Quartet, I have filmed over 100 hours of a Julliard string quartet rehearsing opus 131. The performers were coached by some of the world’s leading chamber musicians.

COMMENTS: 
A modern thriller. Very depressing as current state of the depressed economic world is now even worse! All currencies falling and the Taliban is threatening to rule the world. We follow a family in which the father has lost his job. NYC has become so expensive that they decide to live in a remote cabin in the woods and leave NYC behind. At first there are some cheap thrills with writer using dreams and other false alarms to make you jump in your seat. Eventually the family finds out that the world has actually come to an end, all major cities destroyed. It's the wild wild west out there with looting, murder and fighting for survival. 

Bart Freunlich is never been my favorite. He get films made because he is married to Juliane Moore. I would not pre-buy this film. 

SYNOPSIS:
In a secluded cabin in the snow-covered woods, solemn seven-year-old KATE is spelling “survival” on a scrabble board while her exhausted mother NATASHA grimly rinses blood-soaked rags in the kitchen sink.  Outside, Kate’s thirteen-year-old son ALEX approaches with his father SAM.  Both look spent and wary.  The family attempts to function normally despite some obvious, recent trauma that remains unspoken.  

Flashback six weeks ago.  The family reluctantly leaves their New York City lives; Sam lost his job amid a sudden nationwide financial collapse.  Alex hates to leave his electronic toys, but Sam tries to put an upbeat spin on the whole ‘adventure’.  The family is moving to a secluded cabin far upstate, the home in which Sam grew up, and where Natasha will begin immediately home-schooling the kids.  

They arrive at the cabin and settle in to a life without TV or any modern amenity.  Even electricity is scarce, but Sam enjoys cutting wood and instructs Alex on how to reaffix a belt onto the wheezing generator in the basement, and how to shoot a gun.  Alex has brought along a little Survival pamphlet that he shares with Kate and allows her to borrow.  

After a few weeks, Alex discovers that someone has pitched a tent on their land.  As the adults go to investigate, Alex is sent home.  He retreats to a small hideaway with some old Playboys, and is astonished when the inhabitant of the tent sneaks in just then to steal some bottles of wine.  This is MEAGAN and she’s young and pretty; she talks her way out of The tent’s owner also discovered the hideaway and had snuck into it to steal some provisions for herself.  She is the young and beautiful MEAGAN, and she gets Alex to promise not to reveal who she is, or that she’s camping on their land.  Alex agrees, and Meagan leaves.

Later, Natasha heads to her MOTHER’S in the city to procure some provisions and make sure her mother is all right.  While she’s away, a family friend BRIAN appears at the cabin, shell-shocked.  He tells Sam that civilization has collapsed; anarchy and looting is all that is left of New York, and most of the city’s inhabitants have fled.  Natasha comes to the same conclusion as she arrives at burned-out shell that once was the Big Apple.  She goes to her mother’s home only to find the older woman dead; she is confronted by a LOOTER and nearly kills him, bashing his face with a pipe.  The Looter points to an empty bottle of pills and Natasha realizes her mother killed herself.  After driving the Looter away, she he retrieves some mementos (including her father’s sniper rifle) and burns her mother’s body in the back yard.  

Meanwhile, Brian takes off in search of Natasha so that Sam can stay with his children.  Sam is certain that Natasha needs help, so he leaves the kids for a few hours – assuring Alex that he’ll be back and that the boy is in charge of Kate while he’s gone.  Sam walks out to the local ranger station, only to find it abandoned in a hurry.  He finds a written log with a final entry describing the RANGER’s haste to get back to his own family.  

Back at the house, the electricity supply wavers, so Alex attempts to adjust the generator the way his father showed him.  His sleeve gets caught in the belt and he shouts for Kate to shut it 
BACKWOODS – page 2 

off.  She finally does, but Alex’s finger is badly mangled.  Kate does what she can to treat his wounds with gauze and tape, and then he passes out. 

Sam returns home to a bloody trail and guiltily cuts the skin from the finger, removing it, then ices it while forming a tourniquet for the hand.  Hours later, the trio hears a car driving up from the main road and rejoice – Mom’s home!  But it is not Natasha.  Instead, driving the car is a man named JIM, and inside is Meagan, whom no one but Alex has seen before.  

Sam comes out of the house holding a gun on Jim.  Alex also aims a gun at Jim, which irritates him.  Dazed from loss of blood and clearly freaked out, Alex refuses to lower the weapon, even when Sam asks him to.  Alex startles and shoots Jim, but it’s just a flesh wound, and it enrages the man, who forces Sam and Alex to drop their guns.  Despite Meagan’s pleas, her brother Jim ties up Alex and Sam and treats them as prisoners.  At Jim’s instruction, Sam ties up Alex’s sore hands, and Jim doesn’t see Sam put a sharpened stick into the boy’s hands.  That evening, as Meagan is tending Jim’s wound and then removes Kate to a far bedroom, Sam and Alex try to loosen their bindings and escape.  Jim catches them and knocks Sam out with the gun. 

But little Kate wakes up alone in the back bedroom and remembers what her brother told her about the contents of the survival manual.  She dresses warmly, opens a window, and runs off into the woods by herself.  A concerned Meagan runs after her, but then Meagan is attacked and mauled by a bear.  She is able to fight the bear off, and shoots at it, but she too is badly injured.  Kate, still running and without any knowledge of the bear attack, runs into the street and is nearly hit by Natasha; the girl tells her mother about their family’s captors.  Natasha drives up to the house but remains hidden by the trees.  She instructs the girl to stay in the car while she takes the sniper rifle and positions herself elsewhere.

Injured Meagan begs Jim to let Sam and Alex go.  Jim finally breaks down; the stress and powerlessness is too much.  But Jim finally agrees to cut Sam and Alex free, and approaches them with a giant carving knife.  Outside, Natasha has Jim in her crosshairs, and blows him away.  When Meagan runs in to see what’s wrong Natasha shoots her in the chest.  Natasha runs into the house to be reunited with her family.  In the final beat, Alex and Sam drab the two bodies out into the woods to bury them in the half-frozen ground.  Natasha cleans the puddles of blood from the cabin floor.  As in the opening scene, Kate plays Scrabble alone.

In early 13th century Italy, wealthy silk merchant Francis hears the voice of God and trades material wealth for an impoverished life and gains followers.

COMMENTS
This is a fairly straightforward biopic about an admirable man who lived a long time ago but wasn’t Jesus. Francis had an impressive discipline and a lot of wise things to say, but this script doesn’t entirely succeed in making this character’s philosophy universal across religions or poignantly relevant to present day. Francis’ anger that his monks would dare read any book that wasn’t the Gospel because book knowledge is a form of greed and pride may not sit well with today’s audiences or ME! Does that mean we are all supposed to stay ignorant? He himself knows how to read and write. Is that a sin too? When Francis speaks with the Sultan, there are several interesting debates that begin brushing conflicts more familiar to people in the 21st century, but it is ultimately overshadowed by Francis’ aim to convert the Sultan despite their agreement that their religions are intertwined. Stylistically, the writer added voiceover for most of the characters as they express how Francis influenced them—it would have been interesting to see that choice paid off (who they were speaking to, why they each vocalized these thoughts – maybe to canonize Francis? Modernize this into a documentary-style period piece?); but without such a wrapper they tend to distract more than enhance.
BOTTOM LINE
Francis has an interesting story, being a man who could have had wealth but chose to live in total poverty instead. There are some written gems of wisdom in here and a few internal struggles that are easy to empathize with, but he is not Jesus Christ, and me being clueless about his real popularity amongst Catholics, I can't judge how eager they are to see a film about him. I would say, for Catholics territories only, but I would not pay too much. It could end up as a history lesson, and young audiences will not be interested.

SUMMARY
Ailing 44-year-old monk FRANCESCO (FRANCIS) stumbles through the woods, crying that he’s had a vision that there is nothing after death. Loyal Brother LEO brings him to a cabin where he begs hunter URSO for shelter. Urso recognizes Francis as the legendary monk and questions Francis’ religious devotion. Flashback 20 years earlier to 1204 Assisi, Italy: Francis is the son of a rich silk merchant and enjoys wine and women. While romancing lovely SYLVIA, he mentions having heard God’s voice once during battle and longing to hear it again. Upon leaving the tavern, he sees a leper and gives her his cloak. He walks into the impoverished outskirts of Assisi, then finds a rundown chapel where he meets its solitary inhabitant, a monk named LEO. Francis prays for guidance and believes he must re-build the chapel. He sells his father’s silk for materials and starts rebuilding with Leo. When his father confronts him, Francis gives him all he owns in return until both parents accept his choice and he leaves them forever. 

Months later, Francis’ rich friend BERNARDO returns to Assisi and is shocked to see a happy Francis begging on the street. At dinner, Francis puts ash on his food to discipline his body to not want more than it needs. Their conversation about the false value of material goods inspires Bernardo to give his wealth away and join Francis’ brotherhood. They’re joined by others including PIETRO the lawyer and ELIAS the Canon. They rebuild the chapel, sleep in the stables, help others and live meagerly but joyfully. Francesco wants to preach as well, but he’s not wholly inspired until Leo breaks a clay bowl he made because he became too attached to it. Francis realizes joy is not in triumph but in defeat, when one becomes broken so they can be truly remade by God. He preaches in the piazza when soldiers are being cheered on their way to battle, saying no war is justified, since the only enemy we have is our own sin. Despite the booing, he reminds all that Jesus loved those who hated Him, and he inspires young wealthy lady CHIARA to join his brotherhood. Bishop GUIDO praises Francis’ work, but asks that Chiara be given her own cloisters and that he may only preach if POPE Innocent III sanctions their order, which is considered too strict and austere. The Pope, despite initial misgivings that Francis is a mystic and heretic, has a dream in which Francis supports a collapsing church and personally comes to their humble stables/sleeping quarters to bless the Franciscan Order.

Two years later, their Brotherhood has expanded and Francis decides to leave for the Crusades in Egypt with Pietro. When the Christian soldiers at the hospitals turn their ears from him, an ailing Francis decides to speak with the SULTAN Al-Kamil: if he can convert him, then the war will end. He and Pietro arrive at the Sultan’s tent and Francis’ bravery and intellect impress the Sultan enough to let him live. They talk everyday about religion: Francis insists his God is peaceful, but his followers sometimes justify their wars in His name. He and the Sultan agree their religions are but two branches on the same tree and pray together. But ultimately, the Sultan admits that as long as they agree all faiths are fingers pointing at the moon and not the moon itself, why should he convert? By this point, Pietro insists on taking a sick Francis home to Assisi. 

They return to find the Brotherhood much changed – the monks wear capes and sandals and believe the original order to be too strict to be maintained. Elias writes a more lenient order for Francis to sign. He signs it but then insists it is no longer his order but Elias’ and leaves. Leo joins him and begs him to return and lead the Brotherhood back to its origins, but Francis says he is now the bowl that must be broken. Francis and Leo live in the forest with no possessions until we return to where the film started, where they join Urso who takes them up La Verna Mountain at their request. Francis meditates on a ledge for several days and nights, begging for a sign that all his work will count for something. Leo grows increasingly worried over Francis’ mumbling, and Urso believes Francis to be crazy. Then Francis achieves peace, watching time lapse and realizing during his brief existence, he needs to accept that God’s will be done, not his own. His hands bleed. 

With a new calm that makes Urso a devout believer, Francis returns to the Brotherhood with the wounds of the Stigmata and reconciles with Elias. As Francis dies, Bishop Guido mentions there is talk of Francis being a saint – Elias mutters that he knows Francis is a saint. When he passes away, hundreds of followers bring his body to be buried in the lepers’ graveyard (at Francis’ request). Before burial, Sister Chiara (reaching through the walls of her convent) kisses Francis’ hand. At that moment, a flock of larks springs from a tree and flies off in the shape of a cross.

Fourteen-year-old Ellis heads off to private school back East, leaving his mom and their eccentric caretaker, Goat Man, behind.  As he breezes through academic challenges, Ellis finds that not everything is so easy–– his world has expanded and he must reconcile himself with his father’s new involvement in his life, as well as a dawning understanding that Goat Man might not have it all figured out after all. 

COMMENTS 
A good script– meandering but rarely out of control, Goats is at its best in its lighter scenes, mostly those taking place in Arizona (fortunately there are many).  It can occasionally drag, and seems to have few essentially connected events, giving it a dreamlike quality in which the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.  As a quirky, coming-of-age comedy it works, but Ellis’s surroundings and experiences are so beyond the norm that we can only really connect to his underlying feeling of being a normal kid surrounded by dysfunction.  I would also add that this is a very American story, and though the characters and Ellis’s struggles may be universal, they are expressed through a particularly American set of circumstances.  Recommended with reservations. 

MW COMMENTS
Very American Indie coming of Age stoner movie. Nothing really happens. There are gorky and nice visual moments, but ultimately another movie to premiere at Sundance with no international potential. Squid and the Whale meet The Wackness. It is very unclear who the public for this film is.

SUMMARY 
ELLIS returns from one of his treks into the desert with bearded, eccentric GOAT MAN and his goats and says goodbye to his mom, WENDY.  He is off to Gates Academy, a prestigious boarding school in Pennsylvania.  Upon arrival, he meets his insecure and mildly obnoxious roommate, BARNEY, as well as the COACH of the crew team, who knew ELLIS’s estranged dad, FRANK, when FRANK was at Gates.  ELLIS checks out an attractive dining hall employee, and wishes he had some weed to smoke.  It isn’t long before he’s caught smoking herb with another student by COACH, who blackmails him into joining the crew team. 

Back in Arizona, GOAT MAN tries to figure out how to send ELLIS marijuana through the mail, and deals with WENDY’s new boyfriend, a pretentious jerk named BENNET.  Unable to reach WENDY on the phone, ELLIS decides to take up FRANK’s offer to spend Thanksgiving in D.C.  ELLIS stays at BARNEY’s house in Georgetown, and when they try to buy some weed off of a crazy street dealer, they get locked inside his car and before they can escape, the guy molests BARNEY, forcing him into an open-mouth kiss.  ELLIS meets up with FRANK and his new, younger, pregnant wife, JUDY.  JUDY seems like a reasonable person to ELLIS, and despite getting in trouble with FRANK for sneaking out and smoking weed with BARNEY, and FRANK’s inability to make up for his lack of communication over the years, ELLIS leaves D.C. a little bit closer to his father.  Upon returning to Gates, BARNEY and ELLIS get in a fight, but manage to make up and study together. 

ELLIS returns to Tucson for Christmas holiday and finds that things have changed in his absence:  GOAT MAN has cut off his hair and beard, and started swimming laps early in the morning, mostly to annoy BENNET.  He has also, to ELLIS’s disappointment, slept with their young, bitchy neighbor.  GOAT MAN and ELLIS reconnect over their dislike for BENNET and go on an overnight trek, crossing the Mexican border.  It turns out that GOAT MAN is meant to traffic cocaine across the border, but their trek ends disastrously, with GOAT MAN and one of the goats being swept away by a flooded river.  ELLIS is forced to return home and then back to Gates, ignorant of GOAT MAN’s fate. 

Back at Gates, ELLIS’s bike is stolen, and then recovered by FRANK, who gets punched in the process.  ELLIS learns GOAT MAN is alive when he receives a packet of weed in the mail, but nearly misses the crew race the next day after smoking too much.  After a lecture from COACH, ELLIS renews his commitment to his team.  When he returns to Tucson at the end of the year he finds that BENNET is gone, WENDY has mostly sobered up, and GOAT MAN is there, his old reliable self.  WENDY gives him 40 acres of land for his birthday, and after turning down a hit off a joint from GOAT MAN, we see that ELLIS has settled into his own path.

 A gothic Vampire story set in an all-girls boarding school in New England.   

COMMENTS
Script, though engaging, for me was slightly unsatisfying.  Feels like a lot of the action in the third act needs to be amped up a bit and the denouement did not have the effect that I would have liked this to have.  There are a lot of references to budding sexuality and female desires; the couple of sexual scenes hopefully will come across as erotic yet as this is set in an all-girls boarding school, it may not be too racy as I suspect they are going for the TWILIGHT audience. 

My guess is that this is going to be very atmospheric and stylized, adding to the seductive nature of the material.

The narrator and protagonist is Rebecca, yet the catalyst/vampire is the Ernessa character.  Rebecca deduces fairly quickly that Ernessa is a vampire yet I would have liked to see more confrontation between the two - there are a couple of powerful scenes but the way this is written - are we to believe that Rebecca is emotionally unstable and going through her own demise or is she certain that Ernessa is truly a vampire - there is a good amount of ambiguity.

I like this and think it has potential yet am not sure if this is a pre-buy film.  It has all of the elements but I am not convinced - would recommend reading if teen vampire stories and Mary Harron are appealing.

SUMMARY
Rebecca, a somewhat troubled teen from a humble family of artists is returning to her fancy New England boarding school.  She is incredibly excited to see her best friend Lucy - blond, blue eyed, wealthy - after summer break.  The two have a very special bond which means the world to Rebecca. When a new girl, Ernessa, comes to school, Rebecca immediately gets a weird vibe from her and feels that there is something off about her - she doesn't eat, arms and legs are always covered and there is a weird, earthy, dead animal smell that emanates from her room.  To make matters worse, Lucy seems absolutely taken with her and ignores Rebecca, spending time and growing intimate, as teens girls do, with Ernessa.

Interestingly, Ernessa implies to Rebecca that they have a lot in common - their looks - dark with red lips; daughters of tortured artists who died; they both study Greek and play piano, and she knows that Rebecca's father was a suicide - something that bothers Rebecca.  Rebecca starts following her after animal deaths around campus become more common, and sees Ernessa, skinny with almost translucent skin, flailing to swim and hating the phys ed teacher for forcing her.  Two more deaths on campus come soon after.  Rebecca is convinced that Ernessa is behind all of this.  

All the while, Lucy is growing thinner and paler, while getting more and more close with the vamipress.  Rebecca is distraught, her friends think she acting strangely and one night while smoking hash she has a weird vision involving Lucy and Ernessa - this is when Lucy really takes a turn, and one of her other good friend gets expelled for throwing a chair out the window, apparently induced by the hash.  Soon another of Rebecca's friends, who also believes Ernessa's behavior is odd, was found dead, appearing to have jumped from the window - though upon closer examination, it seems she may have been pushed.

Rececca is reading a vampiric novel in class - Carmilla -and goes to speak privately with her teacher about vampire lore.  The teacher seems to have a bit of a thing for Rebecca and is also slightly worshippy of her deceased father, who was an accomplished poet, not to mention troubled.  He and most of Rebecca's friends feel that she is jealous of Lucy and Ernessa's friendship and is acting out as a result of her father's suicide.

Lucy ends up hospitalized at one point, refusing to see Rebecca but allowing Ernessa for visits.  Rebecca is crushed.  Lucy makes a recovery and Rebecca is convinced Ernessa is going to 'take her' upon her return.  She goes to speak to the English teacher about her suspicions and he dismisses them as jealousy.  The next night, Rebecca follows Lucy and Ernessa out into a field and literally sees Ernessa floating, holding Lucy by her golden hair - then Lucy collapses.  Ernessa disappears and Rebecca runs to Lucy - she is dead.  Rebecca is found with the body and the other girls think she was responsible.

Rebecca knows the truth and continues following Ernessa who keeps appearing to her at odd times, when she is alone and twice offers her a razor blade so that she can 'free herself'.  When Rebecca is finally able to get into the school basement to snoop around and finds Ernessa's trunk - that appears to be ages old, she opens it up to find dirt with the imprint of a body and Ernessa's diary, which she reads.   She is determined to stop the vampire and goes back to her crypt while Ernessa is sleeping in there and tries to set the trunk and Ernessa on fire.  She is taken away for psychiatric care, fulfilling the prophecy everyone believed for her.  Ernessa vanishes...

ALINA, Fidel Castro’s illegitimate daughter, grows up in her father’s shadow. Unhappy with the ways of his regime she eventually resolves to flee the country. 

COMMENTS 
Worth reading; the subject matter seems perfectly suited for awards type material, and there are definitely powerful themes, scenes and segments; as well as one or two exhilarating sequences – most notably when ALINA flees Cuba in disguise.  The relationship between the four generations of women, LALA, NATY, ALINA and MUMIN is particularly powerful, as each stubborn, smart woman is forced to make terrible decisions in an attempt to carve out a life amidst desperate circumstances; and ALINA & MUMIN’s freedom is the culmination of all of their struggles.  Despite the abundance of strong material, the script didn’t move me emotionally in the way I’d hoped; some of the scenes had the potential to be heart breaking, but I never really connected emotionally and think that’s where the script falls short. I also think it drags in points.  Worth reading and considering; interesting project but flawed. Also, Moresco has produced great films but is not really known for direction. 

SUMMARY 
LALA, the narrator of the story, opens the film describing the political strife associated with Castro’s rebellious take over of CUBA from BATISTA. LALA’s daughter NATY is excited to bring her young daughter ALINA to a parade heralding FIDEL CASTRO’s (along with his brother RAUL and his compatriot CHE) triumphant return.  LALA warns her daughter that CASTRO is a “devil” who cares nothing for NATY or ALINA, despite the fact that he is Alina’s father.   NATY is devastated when CASTRO refuses to acknowledge them during the parade.  

NATY’s husband PAPI ORLANDO fears that the revolution will drive him and his peers away, and he flees the island; taking his daughter, NINA (ALINA’s half sister).  NATY doesn’t stop him, her love for Fidel still evident.

In the ensuing months and years, NATY, who considers herself not only Castro’s lover but also an integral member of the revolution, is completely cut off from the inner circle of the revolutionaries, despite her fanatic devotion. Fidel Castro refuses to even see his daughter. 

After relentless persistence, Fidel spends one night at NATY’s home, meeting the beautiful ALINA for the first time; he is instantly smitten with his daughter.  His relationship with NATY, however, will clearly never be rekindled.

NATY takes an overseas job as an ambassador to France, and ALINA is placed in a “voluntary” work camp. She is treated harshly in the camp, so as to avoid accusations of preferential treatment. She befriends Che Guevara’s daughter HILDITA, as well as EDUARDO; a young son of a black market entrepreneur.  EDUARDO provides them with booze, smokes and other illicit material that get them in trouble with the head mistresses of the camp.  EDUARDO, after kissing ALINA, realizes that he is gay.  The leader of the camp catches them skinny dipping, which prompts a visit from Fidel, who reprimands his rebellious daughter. 

Alina is devastated to find that her friends have been removed from the camp.  ALINA goes on a hunger strike… and after her father reacts with a panic, she realizes that she has the power to manipulate him… he is terrified about how it would look to the world if his daughter died of starvation.  “I’m bringing your mother back from Paris… no more of this!”

As a young woman in her early 20s she reunites with Eduardo and Hildita and the three party at nice dance clubs; ALINA irritates her father by marrying a string of worthless men; the last of whom gets her pregnant.  

FIDEL visits Alina in the hospital and meets his granddaughter MUMIN.  Fidel asks her to finally take the Castro name; and give it to her daughter as well, but Alina refuses. 

HILDITA dies of cancer; she tells ALINA that she’s been poisoned (figuratively) since finding out that her father was set up by Fidel; “the necessary hero,” he’d been made into a martyr.  Fidel doesn’t attend the funeral of his former best friend’s daughter. 

Alina becomes more politically aware, and realizes her father’s policies are wildly flawed; especially when he cracks down on “queers” and her friend EDUARDO gets imprisoned and raped by guards. 

ALINA turns to her father for help for Eduardo, but Fidel demands her loyalty in return. ALINA gets Eduardo out and he leaves Cuba, heading for Miami.  

CUBA meanwhile, falls into poverty after the fall of the USSR and Fidel is forced to find a new way to sustain his people economically, opening the door to tourist trade in Havana.  To celebrate, they plan a massive festival in which ALINA will serve as a performer in a gala show. 

EDUARDO sends spies to Cuba to help ALINA defect. She declines the initial offer because she would have to leave her daughter behind, but Eduardo’s friends vow they can help MUMIN get to the USA as well.  ALINA and MUMIN reluctantly agree to the plan. 

The night of the gala show, ALINA dresses in a disguise and barely manages to board a plane to Miami.  MUMIN joins her there shortly thereafter.

Set in a sort of post apocalyptic Los Angeles, which has a perimeter fenced in chain link, and one set of roving gang members that like to kung fu fight intruders, Bloodfist is about one man’s quest to avenge his brother’s death.  When Jonny, a great PITFIGHTER wins a big purse, he goes to a strip club to celebtrate.  He goes outside for a piss and gets killed. The next morning, his brother comes to town, hoping to look up his older bro.  The younger brother is devastated to find out that Jonny has been killed.  He goes to the cops, but the cynical detective SLICK refuses to help and tells the guy to get out of town before he gets hurt.  After Slick sees the younger brother fight off a crazy gang, he suggests that the guy might have success finding out about his brother’s death if he infiltrates the secretive world of pitfighters by becoming one of them.


COMMENTS

A film that looks like it is destined (if lucky) for the straight to video section.  I would be shocked if this was released theatrically.  The production value is laughable at times, the performances are terrible, the script is clichéd and the strippers tits are so fake that I think I saw the scars.  The film boast a Kung Fu champion as its lead, but the action/ fight sequences are poorly choreographed, poorly shot and horribly sound designed (the foley punching sound effect has never been so distracting).  The Kung Fu champ is also an unbearably bad actor.  In its defense, some of its explosions looked well done, and I certainly like to stare at strippers tits as much as the next guy, and this film certainly takes every opportunity to put them onscreen.

COMMENTS:
This film is the 1st of a trilogy they plan to make (Age of Honour and Age of Glory) if all goes well with the first film. It is based on a true story of the formation of James Bond creator Ian Fleming’s 30 Commando, which is one of most exclusive special forces formed during WWII. The premise of this script is intriguing, especially since this led to the ideas behind James Bond. The story follows them as they attempt to take out one of the main Nazi communication centers and technology. The storyline flows relatively smoothly, although they do repeat their mission and their plan more times than is probably necessary. It was a bit confusing on who the main protagonist is supposed to be: Rains or Jones. Jones is being played by Sean Bean, who since his role in “The Lord of the Rings” has been doing well. Rains is a slightly confusing character with his knack for leading people and being a badass, but is out-shined by the other characters after the introduction of himself. He also doesn’t seem to have any flaws. At one point, it seems he might be afraid of heights, but it didn’t take much for him to get over that feeling. Perhaps his character will be more developed in the 2nd and 3rd film. To be continued endings are always frustrating because it gives no closure or resolution to the story, but it might develop a following for the next two films, which would provide a built-in audience. 

This is not a prebuy, but is something to consider if your territory appreciates WWII films, especially the UK since it follows British soldiers. It is currently available in our territories.

SUMMARY
Four British soldiers wait in the trenches for RAINS, a fellow soldier and natural leader. Rains bravely runs to the trenches with an injured soldier on his back. They need to get out of there. They are getting ambushed by the Nazi’s. 

Rains leads his men through the woods until they come upon a Royal Military Police Checkpoint for the British. The police think they are renegades and deserters and lock them all up. Rains and his men just want to go home since they were promised a boat ride home. Rains struggles but it is to no avail. 

Captain JONES and Lt. Commander FLEMING talk about the war with the Germans. The Germans have outstanding technology that traces signaled information. Their mission is to destroy this German technology: RDF’s. Jones meets STEINAR, a Norwegian/ American officer that has volunteered to help with the mission. Mission Grendel.

The Royal Military are giving their prisoners a hard time. Making them run up hills and beating them up with no mercy. Rains gets the brunt of the treatment because he can’t control his mouth. He tries to help another struggling soldier get through the exercises, BRIGHTLING, but the police won’t let him.

Fleming and Jones speak strategy for their mission. They will go in by air, 8-10 men needed, pick-up by air. Jones requests three Marines specifically for this job. Brightling and RILEY, a special sniper. Fleming asks how Jones’ wife is doing. She is due to have her baby any day now. 

Back at the police camp, Brightling does not look good. He keeps getting sicker and sicker. Rains tries to be his friend.

Jones drives his wife, GRACE, who is pregnant, out to her mother’s house to be watched while he’s gone. He tells them he’ll be back soon. 

Jones drives over to the police prison. He talks to the Colonel in charge. He picks up Brightling. Rains begs to be apart of the Commandos. Jones says no. The Colonel and the guards hustle Rains back to the prison camp. Jones smiles at Rains and winks. Rains grabs a guard’s guns and demands to be taken with Jones. They all get in the car and drive away. Jones makes Rains apart of the Commandos.

They pick up MAC, another soldier along the way and head to the training camp. Brightling is too sick to train. 

As they train, Rains meets STEINAR, the sniper. They become friends as they train together. Rains meets another soldiers, GABLE. They all work hard together to train on specific training methods of shooting, rock scaling, and grenades. 

As Rains and Steiner eat dinner together, Rains reveals that he has no family. Fleming finds Rains and tells him the police prison camp wants him back, but Jones convinced Fleming that he needs Rains. 

The crew gets briefed on their mission. Operation Grendal: infiltrate occupied Norway and ambush the main communication center. They need to steal their latest technology kit. Jones introduces the group to ROLLRIGHT, the man who will identify and dismantle the technology. They will be dropped off into the mountains from the air and begin their mission. They have a local contact they will meet in Norway, BEOWULF, whom they’re not sure they can trust. Jones asks Rains to watch over Rollright and make sure he does not get into the wrong hands during the mission. If he does, Rains needs to shoot him. 

The soldiers board the plane, and take off. Once in flight, they are bombarded by enemy fire, they get ready to jump. Rollright is reluctant. Rains pushes him out. As the Rains lands, he notices Rollright being pulled to a cliff by his parachute. Rains cuts him free and saves him. As they round everyone up, they notice one soldier, GRAVES, has died on the way down from a broken neck. The Nazi’s attack the soldiers. The British soldiers make short work of the small troop of Nazi’s and they start trekking through the mountains to the rendezvous point. 

They spot the cabin (rendezvous point) up ahead. Jones sends Rains and Steiner up ahead to check it out first. On they way, Rains falls into a crevice and discovers rows and rows of dead Norwegian soldiers. He is horrified. Steiner is not surprised. 

They get to the cabin and watch a skier slowly reach the cabin and go inside. Rains and Steiner follow. As they creep inside, the skier throws Rains to the floor and there is a stand-off. Turns out the skier is Beowulf, who in turn, is a woman LIV JENSEN, who is their “inside man.”

Rains and Steiner signal the other soldiers to the cabin. The group maps out their next move. It’ll take about 10 hours hiking to get to the main communication center. Jensen knows the way. She will lead them. She starts a Morse code to the main war office.

Meanwhile, another German patrol finds evidence of the British soldier’s drop point. The Germans follow their tracks. 

The main war office receives the message and Fleming gives them the order to proceed. 

The soldiers pack up their things to head to the communications center. They leave a little surprise for anyone who is following them before heading out. 

The Germans who have followed their footsteps reach the cabin. As a couple Nazi’s enter the cabin, they spot a box of chocolates on the table. One soldier reaches for the box and trips a wire that makes the cabin explode. The Nazi General, who watches the explosion, sees the soldier’s tracks leading off into the distance. They pursue. 

The British soldiers have reached their destination and started their assault. Riley gets shot down in the back by the German troop that was following them. Rains, Rollright, and Jensen find the technology kit and begin to strip it down. Rains set up explosives in the communications center. Gable gets gunned down. Jones, Rains, Rollright, Jensen, and Mac drive away with the technology kit. Rains explosives blow up the communications center. 

Mac has been injured by gunfire. They hide out in the woods. Steiner and Rains decide they’re going to the village to get some supplies. Jensen radios the main war office their pick-up codes. Fleming receives the codes, but pick-up is impossible because of the bad weather. They have to head to Sweden for Naval pick-up. Fleming also informed Jones that he had a baby girl. 

Steiner and Rains watch as the Nazi troop execute the entire village so they can’t help the British soldiers. Steiner is infuriated. They go back to their camp and Steiner wants to take revenge. Jones is not sure. He just wants to go home and get out of there. Mac tells the group that Jones now has a baby to think of. The group is torn. Jones orders Jensen to go ahead to Sweden with the technology kit. The rest of the crew will head to the village to kill the Nazi’s.

LOGLINE

During the Indonesian invasion of East Timor in 1975, an Australian TV reporter in over his head searches for five Australian journalists gone missing.

COMMENTS

The film revolves around a startling, brutal conflict in East Timor that has been relatively underreported, the story follows a reporter who traces the path of five of his colleagues who have disappeared while trying to cover the Indonesian invasion of the small island nation.  The historical details are fascinating, the script creates a nice sense of impending doom, and the lead character is interesting, but there’s something missing; the plot never delivers quite the tension you’d expect, the use of flashbacks and alternative point of views effectively undercutting the brutality and making the images less affecting.    

SUMMARY

2007 - East Timor.  JULIANA CORTEZE, of the town Dili, is interviewed by the United Nations about December 7, 1975, when Indonesia invaded its neighbor East Timor.  At eight Juliana saw the murder of ROGER EAST (our main character), an Australian who befriended Juliana while staying at her father’s hotel.  Real footage of the invasion is interspersed.  We’re thrown back to 1975.  

November 1975.  Roger East, a journalist spinning government propaganda, hates his job.  JOSÉ RAMOS HORTA, a naïve revolutionary from East Timor and a fan of Roger, begs him to head a free news agency once his revolution succeeds.  He says five young Aussie journalists have disappeared.  News reports show Indonesia bombing East Timor.  Roger visits TONY MANIATY, a shaken reporter fresh from Balibo.  Despite Tony’s warnings, Roger is driven.  He flies to Dili and joins Horta to retrace the journalists’ steps.  Roger stays at the Hotel Turismo as the other journalists had.  He’s fed by JOAO, the hotelier and Juliana’s father.  Joao relates that the journalists disappeared from Balibo, near the Timor-Indonesian border – on a trip arranged by Horta!  Roger befriends Juliana.
Roger and Horta visit the journalists’ driver Ximinez, who confides he waited for the men two miles south of Balibo.  They remained in the town amid its fall to Indonesian soldiers to film the barrage.  Ximinez draws a map – the journalists had gone on foot to an old Mission school in the mountains, an agreed retreat point.  Roger gets Horta to lead him there.  In flashback the journalists bond with villagers and Fretilin soldiers (the revolutionary party in East Timor).  The beleaguered villagers ask why Australia won’t defend East Timor, as it had them in WWII.  The reporters reach the Mission school and enjoy the joy of the oblivious villagers.

The next day Horta and Roger evade a sniper.  Horta realizes the chopper wasn’t after him; it was after Roger.  This infuriates Roger – he was lured here to be a martyr for Horta’s cause!  They scuffle, and Horta takes off.  Fretelin commander SABIKA brings a hostage – an East Timorese soldier who spied for Indonesia.  The spy says the journalists’ bodies are in Balibo, which is left empty at night.  Roger pleads for the man’s life.  Sabika agrees to take Roger to Balibo.  In flashback the journalists hunker down in Balibo, film the Indonesian onslaught, and hide. Pinned on all sides, the journalists are discovered and brutally executed.

Roger and Sambika arrive in Balibo under cover of night.  The journalists’ bodies are gone, but blood stains remain.  They escape back to Dili safely.  Roger and Horta make peace – Horta tells Roger to leave; the Indonesians are coming to Dili.  Horta’s leaving to advocate for independence elsewhere.  Roger refuses – he’ll stay and tell the story.  He does a radio broadcast, reporting the facts as they weren’t reported by his own government.  The Indonesian soldiers take Roger from the radio station along with other Dili inhabitants, and shoot the lot of them.  Young Juliana witnesses this, and we are back to the present.  Epilogue stills show the long story of East Timor’s independence, finally achieved by Horta in 1999.

Cute but fairly clunky, the main plot is sidetracked a bit by some extraneous scenes.  The characters are appealing, though shallow—the bad guys’ motivation seems to be generalized corporate greed, and indeed the whole movie seems to capitalize on the present public backlash against big business in general.  This lack of specificity/depth weakens the conflict and can feel a bit manipulative, as well as lazy in what is otherwise a fun script.  Pass.

SUMMARY
As the movie opens, we see SARA COOK, bloodied and taking cover in a bank just as SWAT teams storm the building.  Flashing back two months earlier, SARA drives on to her father’s worksite.  She overhears her father, BOB COOK, meeting with DUKE BAILEY, the man who is trying to force him to sell his construction company.  BAILEY tells BOB that he will have to sell, as BAILEY has acquired a controlling interest in the state bank and BOB’s credit line won’t be extended.

STEVE BAILEY, DUKE BAILEY’s son, leaves the strip club after a lap dance from SARA’s friend ASH on his way to the bank.  Upon arrival, he informs another of SARA’s friends, JULIE, that he is the new manager of Western National Bank of Texas.

SARA heads off to work bartending at the local trucker bar, deals handily with some tough customers and is assaulted at the end of the night only to be rescued by ASH.  JULIE shows up and the three of them bemoan the changes that have come about the town.  The next day, SARA and ASH show up at the bank to tell JULIE that they are going to start robbing banks in order to help BOB (who is by far the largest employer in town).

SARA and ASH dress up like cowboys, complete with facial hair, and rob a nearby bank.  It goes incredibly smoothly so they decide to try again; increasing the sum they’re after.  Posing as construction workers sent by with coffee, they drug all the bank employees and simply waltz into the vault.  This time, ASH leaves some anti-corporation graffiti that gives the “Cowboy Bandits” some media attention and positive spin from all but DUKE BAILEY.  After one more audacious and increasingly dangerous robbery, BAILEY calls in female corporate assassin, ULYSSES FOX.  The girls filter the stolen money through REV. JACOB at the local church, who then passes it along as an anonymous donation to BOB COOK’s company.  Over the next few days, the girls discover they have copycats—fortunately for them, as with some new security precautions and preparation, ULYSSES FOX catches the copycat burglars and kills them.  Our heroes rob another bank and manage to escape by removing their costumes and posing as civilians caught in the bank.  ULYSSES FOX figures out their trick after examining the security tapes and vows to get them.

SARA hooks up with a particularly attractive and intelligent trucker, TRAVIS, who has managed to finally win her over, and heads out the next day to rob the local branch, where JULIE works.  They steal STEVE’s ledger, which contains records of BAILEY’s shady transactions, and when ULYSSES FOX confronts them, they manage to expose her previous murders by sending footage off a hidden camera to the media.  There is a gunfight, Julie is shot in the leg, and when SARA and ASH attempt to escape with SARA’s sister, BECKY, SARA is shot as well.  TRAVIS rescues her, ASH is confronted by the SHERIFF, her father, who lets her go– and BECKY ducks back into school.  They blow up the bank once it has been cleared of people, get the money to BOB, who presents a check to BAILEY, covering his debt and saving his business.

LOGLINE
 
A doctor’s seemingly perfect life unravels after he tries to kill raccoons that have been tearing up his lawn, and events spiral out of control until he has wound up cheating on his wife twice, fathering an out of wedlock child, getting his life savings dumped off a bridge and partially instigating a murder… of a pregnant woman. 


COMMENTS

This is an oddball script with a purposefully bizarre plot that turns bucolic suburban life on its head; reading a bit like a more malevolent version of LITTLE CHILDREN. Fun, ridiculous part for Laura Linney as the crazy, sex starved cat loving neighbor.  The role of LINCOLN is also captivating; he’s a pleasant fellow with an undercurrent of violence that is hinted at and finally boils over, in a touch that I thought was by far the best aspect of the script.  There are a bunch of strong moments, I really like JEFF dumping the cash off the bridge; as well as the sex scene between PETE and REBECCA. Despite all of the things I liked about it, the script veered along a bit like a runaway train, and at times, I found it just too ridiculous and the tone (dark comedy? Scathing satire) was a bit hard to pin down. Similarly problematic, there’s an ensemble full of interesting smaller roles, but the two main characters seem pretty unlikeable, cold hearted, constantly betraying each other… Flawed but interesting script.  Worth reading. 

SUMMARY 

JEFF lives a seemingly perfect life, his wife NEALY and he celebrate their tenth wedding anniversary, he’s a doctor, they’ve got a nice house and a lovely two year old son;  There’s just a few problems – firstly, he and Nealy don’t really have sex; secondly, raccoons are ripping up the front yard. Jeff obsessively tries to fix the second problem, ignoring the first, compensating by jerking off while emailing hookers off craigslist. (But never actually sleeping with them). 

No matter what JEFF tries the raccoons keep ripping up his lawn.  “This is actually mountain lion urine.” NEALY gets so sick of it that she winds up hitting him in the face and giving him a black eye. It turns out that NEALY is having an affair with a guy named CHRIS.  She begins to feel terrible and breaks it off. 

Nealy finds JEFF’s dirty emails and confronts him.  He is embarrassed and promises that he has never actually gone through with the liaisons.  NEALY tells him she needs time apart. “I think we can still work this out Nealy!”  They have wild sex. 

LILA, a crazy neighbor, loses her cat, and JEFF realizes that he accidentally poisoned it while trying to kill the raccoons.  Stressed, Jeff goes to hang out with his friend REBECCA and winds up getting stoned and sleeping with her.   Her husband finds out, and so does LILA,  who uses the info to blackmail him and forces him to sleep with her as well. 

REBECCA’s husband PETE confronts JEFF about the affair and blackmails him, demanding 200k. PETE meets him on a bridge.  Jeff gives him 75 grand to keep him quiet and PETE dumps the entire briefcase full of cash into the river below. 

JEFF decides he needs to make amends in his life and donates his kidney to LINCOLN.  He is lauded as a hero in the local news, but his satisfaction is short lived; LILA visits him in the hospital to tell him that she’s pregnant. 

JEFF tells LINCOLN about LILA.  Lincoln seems to get unhinged, and unbeknownst to JEFF, he buys a crossbow and kills Lila with an arrow; exactly the way Jeff admitted that he fantasized about killing her.

JEFF confesses everything to NEALY: confesses about sleeping with Rebecca and about the blackmail money and sleeping with LILA and LINCOLN’s murder.  Nealy asks him if he still loves her and he gives her an honest answer; he’s conflicted, but yes he still loves her.  They stay together and have another child.

A 3D children's move for EXTREMELY young kids; like, six year olds, tops. Its not well written, the story is just silly, and the clever quips meant to draw chuckles from the parents subjected to watching it are all just terrible.
The chihuahua Hector is pretty funny, but he's such a generic stereotype that I shudder to even single him out as one of the  stronger aspects of the script.   A sales person once said, 'all dog   movies' make money. If that's actually true, here's a dog movie. If   that's not true, this is the film that will disprove the theory.     Video / Dvd value for popcorn/ family audiences;  this is a far cry from Pixar quality stuff, and surely there's something better out there.  The director isn't very exciting and there's no cast yet...   although, its a talking dog movie, so the cast will only be voice actors, and likely redubbed.  Pass. I beg you.

A young Nubain princess is captured by the Mujahadeen and sold into slavery.  Her father spends the next several years, desperately searching for her, while she gets send to London to serve as a domestic slave.  
 
COMMENTS
A well written script about a very tough subject matter.  Again, political fare from Range but this is a more gritty story. I have certain misgivings: stylistically, the flashbacks and feverish intercutting between the two stories got a bit overwhelming and actually served to diminish some of the power of the individual plotlines for me.  That said, there were a handful of very powerful sequences and scenes, most notably the scene where SAID realizes he can’t help MENDE, and the scene where MENDE is caught by HANAN as she tries to leave.  It’s worth reading, but in terms of prebuys, it feels like a small, political piece that is hard edged enough it wont necessarily appeal to crossover audiences. It’s got a muted happy ending rather than a truly emotionally satisfying one. (More realistic, for certain, but still felt like an emotional disappointment for me.) 
 
SUMMARY 
Prologue. As a child in the Nuba Desert, young MENDE runs away from home, but collapses, crying, into her father’s arms when he retrieves her. “Promise never to run away again.” 
 
Years later. MENDE, 18, lives with HANAN, and her family.  MENDE is a prisoner; HANAN confiscates her passport after MENDE tries to leave in the middle of the night.  MENDE runs away again and screams desperately for help from African passersby but she gets caught by her captors driver, SAID. “Get in.” 
 
Flash back: As a young teen, MENDE is proud of her father, BAH, the Nubain tribe’s top wrestler and King.  Her joy is undercut by the ominous approach of Mujahadeen soldiers. 
 
Present. HANAN catches MENDE making a phone call.  Despite being nice about it and seemingly forgiving MENDE, she is clearly nervous about getting caught having a slave and warns Mende that if AMIR (HANAN’s husband) finds out about it, he “will have your family killed.” 
 
Flashback. MENDE and several other young villagers are captured,  mutilated and taken from the village.  BAH believes that she is still alive and vows to find his daughter.  Mende is taken to Khartoum where she works for a mean woman named RAHAB (HANAN’s sister)  who beats her and generally treats her as something less than human. 
 
Bah finds out that most of the children were sold to Khartoum and heads there, in desperate search for her.
 
Bah keeps looking for her, for six years; sending word and money back to his wife.  An NGO advises him to return home. “You don’t know what she looks like any more. 
 
Meanwhile, MENDE earns the ire of HANAN by interacting with a local shopkeeper; and HANAN also grows jealous of the emotional bond forming between MENDE and HANAN’s two sons, whom MENDE is now essentially raising.  MENDE also grows closer with AMIR’s driver, SAID, who promises to help her if she should ever need.  SAID is concerned about her and asks what she gets paid a week; MENDE struggles to answer. 
 
At a dinner party, one of HANAN’s friends, IBRAHIM, fondles MENDE and causes a stir.  HANAN is mortified and the embarrassment she believes MENDE has caused, and isfurious with her slave. 
 
After the guests leave, HANAN beats MENDE mercilessly.  MENDE is then locked away in a room (presumably to allow time for her bruises to heal) where she falls into a fever and begins hallucinating; the past and present weaving together in a seamless stream.  MENDE recalls a time in KHARTOUM when she nearly reunited with her father. She saw him at a supermarket and screamed his name, but he didn’t hear her and the two remained separated.  RAHAB got so upset with her outburst that she resolved to send Mende to London. “My sister has been nagging me for a slave.” 
 
In the present, MENDE, bruised and relegated to cooking and cleaning by the spiteful HANAN, she contemplates suicide, but eventually tries to escape, turning to SAID for help. She is devastated when he reveals that he cannot help her. “I can’t lose this job.” 
 
MENDE sees a NUBA man boarding a local bus. She plots a way to escape to meet him on the street. She pleads to him for help.  “You are from a line of kings, what are you doing asking me for help?” 
 
Flashback. The Mujahadeen raid the village; BAH pleads with his daughter to run, as the villagers are being killed around them.  Her attempted escape is intercut with Mende’s presend day  attempted escape from the London house.  BAH loses grip on his daughter and Mende is caught by the Mujahadeen. 
 
MENDE opens the door to leave and is caught by HANAN who alternately threatens her and pleads with her to stay.  MENDE rushes out the door and is saved by AKUOT BOL. She calls her father, who bursts into tears.  Despite achieving freedom from slavery, she cannot return to Sudan for fear of reprisals.

LOGLINE
The darkest secret from a man’s past comes back to haunt him, threatening to destroy his new life.

COMMENTS
This is a thriller with no thrills, an obvious mystery, a ‘psychological’ film whose characters are so dumb that a lobotomized chimp could tell them where things are headed.  The tension is contrived, the events so extreme as to be laughable.  This script is why film-students and would-be screenwriters should have to be issued a license before they’re allowed to watch Psycho, The Shining, or any David Lynch film.

SUMMARY 

HARRY GREEN, a haggard 30 year old agoraphobic, is awakened from a nightmare and comforted by his doting, almost inappropriately affectionate mother BETH.  She questions him and almost arbitrarily interprets it to mean that he will meet an ‘old fashioned girl’.
	The next morning, he is harassed, in what has become a ritual, by neighborhood kids leaving a flaming bag of dog crap on the front step.  While on the front step, he retrieves a package from the mail – jewelry, a Valentine’s gift for his mother.  She keeps the brooch, he keeps the velvet box, adding it to the growing collection of boxes and packaging in his bedroom.  He has a flashback to his youth, watching a man and a woman surreptitiously having sex in an attic.   Harry snaps out of it when his mother asks him to go to the bank; he barely gets through the errand and vomits once home again
	Later, their new neighbor MARIA arrives, and stops by to introduce herself and her young daughter KIKI.  Beth volunteers Harry to help.  While moving a cabinet for Maria, Harry rips his trousers, and shyly, reluctantly accepts Maria’s offer to mend them, accepting her rationale that, as a nurse, she is used to seeing men with their pants off.  Upon hearing the story, Beth is less than impressed with Maria.
	The next day, after another nightmare, Harry uses some old binoculars to spy on Maria sunbathing in her yard.  Knowing that he’s watching, she decides to put on a show, and unties her bikini top, looking directly at him.  Embarrassed, Harry retreats from the window, and has another flashback to the couple in the attic.  That afternoon, Beth and Maria converse over the fence, as Beth tries to discover why the young woman would move out to this small town in the middle of nowhere, and finds out that Maria is being stalked by her obsessive ex husband.
	Maria has to start work earlier than expected, leaving Kiki with Beth, who once again volunteers Harry as well, this time to walk the dog.  All smiles to her neighbor’s face, Beth complains relentlessly to her son.  In the evening, Harry goes over to help Maria fix a broken window – someone has broken a window. Grateful for his help, Maria persuades him to stay for a drink.  Her technique with the glass and the ice cubes are pornographic; smitten, Harry offers to be Kiki’s permanent sitter, which gets him a kiss.
	Beth does not react well to the news, and spends the next day trying to turn his son against Maria, comparing her to the ‘sluts’ that Harry’s father ran around with before he died in an ‘accident’.  Harry is plagued by more attic flashbacks as he spies on Maria in her bedroom with a man, then once again has nightmares when he goes to sleep.
	As Harry settles into a new daytime routine with Kiki, Beth starts bad-mouthing Maria at the hair salon. After walking with Kiki to meet Maria after work, he sees her flirting with every passing man, but it doesn’t stop him from falling for the same tricks that night.  Her seduction is cut short by more vandalism. He runs to look for the culprits, and goes home to see if his mother heard anything.  Beth is laying on the floor, claiming to have sprained her ankle, although she won’t let him call a doctor.
	Much to Beth’s chagrin, Harry has Maria come over to look at her ankle, then goes to keep an eye on Kiki.  Once he’s gone, Beth tells Maria about the mysterious death of the last man who lived next door, who drowned in two inches of bathwater. Beth goes on to suggest evil supernatural forces at work, and urges her neighbor to move out for her own safety.  Returning home, Maria questions  Harry about his relationship with his mother, then cuts off his bumbling attempts to pick up where they left off before.
	When he confronts Beth about her comments, she turns on the waterworks and once again blames his cheating father for ruining her life, then asks Harry to stop seeing Maria. 
	On his way to bring Maria some flowers, Harry is stopped dead in his tracks – Maria is in the front yard with MIKE, her ex husband.  He stands there in the rain as they go into Maria’s house. Later, he watches from his window as Mike tries to rape her.  Harry runs off to the rescue.
	Mike, of course, beats the hell out of him.  With her ex distracted, Maria pulls a gun and forces Mike to leave, then shows her gratitude to her would-be hero by taking his virginity.  Left at home alone, Beth is ranting to herself, as though her dead, cheating husband is somehow responsible for Harry’s corruption. Asleep in Maria’s arms, he has a nightmare that completes the flashback, with the woman from the attic bashing the man over the head with a cane.
	At home the next morning, he finds Beth in the wreckage of her torn up room, among ripped up pieces of a photograph.  He puts it back together and sees the man from his dreams.  This is his father, who Beth claimed to have no pictures of. She quickly becomes hysterical again, thinks that Maria is trying to take her son away.
	Upon returning home from a day at the pool, Kiki, Harry, and Maria find the dog murdered, chopped in half with an axe. Investigating, Harry finds the brooch that he gave his mother next to the dog’s remains.  He goes home to confront Beth, who responds with flimsy denials and begs him to stay, but he heads back to Maria’s after being assaulted by his mother’s cat.  That night, she kills the cat with a straight razor, and tries to blame it on the spirits the next morning.
	Harry and Maria feel guilty until he finds the used straight razor.  Having given Beth a Valium, they talk things over, Harry professing his love even after Maria admits to being a prostitute.  He proposes, she says yes.  As they take an afternoon nap, Beth sneaks in and steals Kiki. They chase her to the railroad tracks, where a train is approaching.  Harry talks her down, gets her to let the little girl go, but Beth throws herself in front of the train.  As she lays dying, Beth tells Maria to take care of Harry.

About a girl (NATALIE PORTMAN) who dance in the NY Ballet, and is in the chorus. The lead girl in the company named BETH is getting too old and the popularity of the ballet is on the wane, so she will likely be fired, so they need a new prima ballerina.  The manager of the ballet (VINCENT CASSELL) auditions a few girls, and NINA, auditions for Swan Lake; initially, she doesn’t get it because she’s frigid and doesn’t capture both the White Swan and Black swan side necessary for the role.  She manages to convince Vincent that she could have a dark side, so she gets the part.  The girl who gets passed over for the role, VERONICA, grows angry and jealous and starts picking on her.  NINA is insecure because she had an overbearing mother, who treats her like a little girl.  Mother blames her pregnancy for ending her career. The mother’s relationship is troubling, creepy, and stalkerish. 

Another new girl at the ballet, LILY, takes NINA out and the two become friends. 
The director wants NINA to come out of her shell, advising her to masturbate to have her first orgasm, make her less shy and frigid.  They need the opening of the show to be a big success because the company is failing. 

COMMENTS
Doesn’t like weak women, annoys MW that she’s a weak girl. Nothing in the script seems like people would actually act that way.  Often things seem like an exaggeration; nobody will be as frigid as NINA, mothers aren’t as crazy as the Mother, are the other ballerinas really going to be so openly mean… it all rings untrue. 

Movie is about the frigid girl blooming into something fuller, which parallels the ballet SWAN LAKE.

LOGLINE 
	Lord Simon Belmont and his legion of loyal troops flee to a mysterious castle to escape slaughter by the Turks.   Dwelling in the castle is Dracul’a, a vicious vampire who plans to kill the men and steal Simon’s lover.  Based on the classic videogame.

COMMENTS – by Steven Murphy

	Adaptations of videogames into scripts can often be dull and lackluster, but this script was crackling with tension and strong characters.  There are several exciting sequences, most notably the intro with the dead German soldiers, and Dracul’a’s flashback about the deadly fight between Dracul and the Turks.  The actions sequences are well done, although one of them (the Turks being slaughtered once they enter Castlevania) struggles mightily to incorporate aspects of the videogame.  The end of the film seems a little tacked on, cutting from 1691 to present day NYC to show AURICA still living  (presumably as a vampire) and waiting for her love Simon to be reborn.  
	All in all, it’s a fast read and should be enjoyable.  

SUMMARY 

	World War II. CAPTAIN WEIDNER and his German soldiers battle the Russians and find a DOZEN DEAD GERMANS in the forest.  Strangely, there are no bullet wounds on the slaughtered bodies, nor are there any enemy corpses.  Weidner leads his troops into the nearby village of Albencarth.  MAYOR PATRESCU claims to have not seen the Russians in town.  He also won’t say who is in the humongous castle overlooking the town.  WEIDNER takes the women and children of town hostage and leads his men to the castle.  There, they are killed by a swarm of a thousand BATS, and a mysterious shadowy figure.  We see Patrescu and the villagers dump the soldiers and all of their vehicles into a nearby lake—a lake that also holds the vehicles of several previous armies, it appears.  We flash back to—
	December 20, 1576 – LORD SIMON BELMONT, a young, but battle-hardened Romanian knight, rides his horse through the same woods that Weidner found his compatriots.  He is flanked by his brother CRISTOFOR and their wise old family friend, VLAS.  They are tracking the Turks, when Simon happens upon the beautiful Gypsy AURICA, whose traveling party has been killed by wolves.  Simon rescues her from the strangely mesmerizing effect of a GRAY WOLF’s stare.  They are then chased by a hundred WOLVES, who proceed to kick the shit out of the humans until Lord Belmont’s back-up arrives.  The wolves retreat.  The Gray Wolf is now Black, and we see that he casts the shadow of a man on the trees as he leaves.  They ride into the village, and are greeted by MAYOR PATRESCU—the same man who greets the Germans 4 centuries later!  Belmont, curious about the huge castle, investigates it for Turks.  There, he meets its Lord, VLAD DRACUL’A.  He is a creepy, shadowy figure.  
	No sooner are they introduced then the Turks appear in the village.  Belmont’s men are forced to retreat into the castle.  The Turks charge, outnumbering Belmont’s men 100-1, but Dracul’a is not worried.  Just as they reach the castle, it starts to defend itself: spikes shoot out from walls to impale and trap the soldies; the trapped ones are sprayed with oil and then lit on fire by Dracul’a; the entrance bridge rotates like a spit, dumping soldiers to their deaths; statues spit steel DARTS.   
	At dinner, Dracul’a explains his legacy and the reason for the Dragon symbol adorning the floor of his main hall (the symbol is one that angers the Romanians).  Vlad Dracul’a’s “father,” a man who in paintings resembles Dracul’a exactly, led the Romanians to their first major victory over the Turks.  However, KING RADU became so jealous that he accused the elder Dracul’a of employing the Dark Arts, as well as eating the flesh and drinking the blood of Romanians.  His woman, ALICI’A (who looks exactly like Aurica), was burned at the stake for witchcraft.  That day he swore vengeance.   He escapes from prison and kills King Radu.  He swore that he would wait for Alici’a to return; from the looks of it, he’s found her again in Aurica.
	During the dinner, the Belmonts’ dog, Florian, becomes agitated at the food.  Suddenly, Cristofor sees the food for what it is: rotten and maggot-ridden.  He sees demons in the faces of Dracul’a and all of the VILLAGERS, and he runs from the table.  As Belmont’s men go in search of Cristofor, Dracul’a retires to his chapel, where he feasts on the blood and flesh of two captive Turk soldiers.  He shares his meal with his THREE BRIDES—undead women who bare a resemblance to Alici’a but are not as beautiful as Aurica.  The blood rejuvenates them, and they go on a spree, killing the knights who search for Cristofor.  Dracul’a saves Aurica from the jealous brides; Aurica falls into a trance as soon as he sets eyes on her.  There is a strong connection.
	Simon worries about Dracul’a; he gives Aurica his crucifix to wear and puts a guard at her door.  That night, Aurica is visited by Dracul’a, whose flesh is seared by her cross.  She wakes up not knowing whether this was a dream or not.  As his men search for their missing comrades, Simon finds Aurica in the woods.  They are immediately surrounded by Turks, and Simon kills all seven of them.  Elsewhere, we see Florian, the dog, finding Cristofor, who is pale and huddled in the dark recesses of the castle.  When Simon and Aurica return to the castle, they find the dog Florian, dying from a bite wound.  They find Cristofor, covered in blood and convulsing; on his sick bed, he tells Aurica that the Dragon is coming for her.  Aurica knows this to be true; she’s afraid.  They soon find the dead KNIGHTS, also drained of blood.  That night, Cristofor regains his strength and tries to break free from his room; Simon is forced to kill his now-demonic brother.  While impales on Simon’s sword, Cristofor says, “I’m sorry.”  Many of Simon’s men abandon the castle, believing he’s led them through the Gates of Hell.  Simon decides to leave.
	As Aurica packs, she is attacked by Dracul’a’s jealous brides, only to be saved by Dracul’a himself.  She falls into a trance, as he tells her he’s waited 100 years for her return.  She submits to him, ditching her crucifix; she allows Dracul’a to approach and sink his fangs into her neck,  Simon tries to save her, but Dracul’a breaks his sword and whip.  Simon, though, manages to retrieve the crucifix and burn Dracul’a, who falls out the bedroom window to his apparent death.  Aurica knows he is alive; she can feel him, because they are “joined.”  This is evident in the crucifix burn she has on her forehead, at the exact spot Dracul’a suffered it.  Simon begins a manhunt for the dark Lord.
	While playing with a chess board, out of frustration, Simon manages to trigger a secret passageway; the dragon mosaic on the floor of the main hall turns to a spiral staircase, leading to Dracul’a’s lair.  Vlas and the remaining knights agree to hold off the VILLAGERS now storming the castle to defend Dracul’a.  Simon takes Vlas’s sword and heads downward.  The villagers have turned lizard-like and are scaling the castle walls with ease.  They are now known as Dracul’a’s UNDEAD FAMILIARS.  Vlas and his men fight valiantly to fend them off.  Downstairs, Simon finds Dracul’a’s chambers.  Unfortunately, Dracul’a is immune to the power of the crucifix while in the center of his dark, lifeless chamber.  “Your God has no dominion here,” he says.  Then, Cristofor appears, back from the grave, and Simon is forced to kill him again.  He then lures Dracul’a out of the circle of rocks at the center of his chamber, and is able to impale Dracul’a on his sword.  The Dark Lord fights it, scrambling to his bride Aurica for her help, but she merely pushes the sword in deeper.  With Dracul’a dead, the Undead Familiars finally stop attacking Vlas, Simon’s lone remaining soldier.  Simon is dying, the Familiars bow before their new Queen Aurica.  She tells Simon, “I will wait for you.”  We flash forward to the present day, as TOURISTS explore Dracul’a’s castle.  Then, we peek in to a skyscraper, newly built above Ground Zero in Manhattan.  On the top floor, Aurica (now a powerful CEO) is approached by her right hand man, who asks her what she plans to do this evening.  “The same thing I do every day.  Wait, Vlas…Wait.”

CAST: Ryan Philippe, Chris Cooper
STATUS: Preproduction
GENRE:  Espionage Thriller/ Drama

LOGLINE 

Based on the true story of FBI agent turned spy Robert Hanssen (Cooper) and upstart agent Eric O’Neill (Phillippe) who is assigned to watch the suspected double agent. 

SUMMARY 

ROBERT HANSSEN, a veteran FBI agent kneels in prayer at a large church in Manhattan.  He clutches a rosary and mouths the novena before walking out into the wild streets of the real world.  

FBI agent MICHAEL ROCHFORD supervises a team of agents that carefully inspects hundreds of pages of documents labeled “evidence” in an unidentified hotel room.  Elsewhere, an FBI agent named RICH GARCIA supervises the construction of an office that is being rigged with the latest in surveillance equipment, microphones, heat sensors and cameras set up to catch every movement in that happens in the office.

FBI junior member ERIC ONEILL takes photos of a Libyan national and his wife, having an argument on the sidewalk.  Eric is undercover, dressed like a bum.  Excited with his successful surveillance, he happily reports to his boss that he thinks the Libyan’s wife “can be turned.”  His boss, OLSEN, who simply scolds him for stealing a stapler. 

Eric plays liar’s poker with his fellow junior agents, and prides himself on his ability to “read” people and predict when they are bluffing.  Olsen unenthusiastically peruses a report that Eric has submitted about a subject database.

Hanssen is also trying to fight bureaucracy and create technological progress in the FBI.  He hacks into RICH GARCIA’s computer to prove that the FBI’s firewalls are insufficient security devices.  Garcia is livid.  “Bob, do I have to tell you how fireable this is?”

Rochford and his men finish cataloging the evidence, which includes tape recordings of Hanssen’s voice.  Hanssen walks to his car, buried in the depths of the FBI lot in an unreserved spot.  Hanssen’s trunk of his silver Taurus is filled with guns.


Eric, at home with his wife JULIANNA in their damp small apartment gets the phone call that he’s been eagerly awaiting.   He’s going on assignment, undercover.  “You’re going to ride the desk of an agent named Robert Hanssen.”  KATE, Eric’s new boss, tells him that Hanssen’s been involved in distributing porn on the internet using FBI computers, and that they want to catch him before the scandal erupts.  “He’s the best computer guy we’ve got.   He’s also a sexual deviant.”  Kate gives him a beeper – he has to answer to her at all times.  He is to report Hanssen’s every movement.  

Eric reports to duty in his new office.  Hanssen does not greet him.  Hanssen is moving in to the office that Garcia and his team have wired.  Hanssen is rude demanding and abrasive. “Your name is clerk.  My name is sir, or boss if you can manage.”  Hanssen is smart, cagey and one step ahead of Eric.   Doing surveillance on this guy is going to be near impossible.  He knows almost instinctually that Eric has been snooping in his office.  “If I ever catch you in my office again you’ll be pissing purple for a week.”

Eric tries to peek at Hanssen’s computer while Hanssen is out of the office, but Hanssen’s skill is uncanny- he immediately calls “are you in my office?”

Eric goes home, exhausted and worn down.  He kisses Julainna, and is immediately by a page from Kate. “Where are my pages?”  The next day, Hanssen comes into the office with a copy of Eric’s report about the “subject database.”  He seems impressed by Eric’s work, and isn’t surprised that the upper levels of the FBI have completely ignored it.  “That’s because you don’t shoot.  The FBI is a gun culture.  Every director has been from the law enforcement side.  Guys who shoot.  Guys who make arrests.”

Eric is being run ragged, trailing the secretive cagey Hanssen and reporting to Kate the meaningless minutiae of the man’s life.  Kate scolds him “a security camera could tell me this.” 

Hanssen takes Eric to mass, and then invites him and Julianna to Sunday mass.  Julianna feels really uncomfortable at mass, like the Hanssens (Robert and his wife BONNIE) are scrutinizing her every move.   After mass, at the Hanssen’s house, Eric checks out his home computer and finds that the most recent page visited on the Internet was a Pope’s home page.

Eric confronts Kate.  Eric is growing to admire Hanssen and he accuses her of trying to railroad Hanssen.  She drops a bomb on him: ‘He’s a traitor.  Started spying for the Russians in 85.”   She shows him all the investigators and surveillance equipment set up to trace Hanssen’s every move, so they can catch him giving information to the Russians and get the death penalty for treason.  They need this as a weapon against Hanssen so he’ll agree to tell them all the information and spies that he has betrayed, so they can protect their agents.  Hanssen is so good at subterfuge that he was in charge of the task force to find the mole inside the FBI.   Eric is devastated.

When he gets home, he is shocked to find Hanssen and Bonnie sitting in his living room. He has to lie about his whereabouts.  Julianna is really upset with him.  She is tired of being given no information from Eric, tired of never knowing what he’s doing or where he’s going, and she’s really tired of the Hanssen’s.  She thinks they’re creepy.  Eric is nearing the breaking point.  He turns to his father for help, who gives him the advice “get on the boat, do your job, and get back home again.”

Kate wants to copy the data off Hanssen’s palm pilot.  He rarely leaves it alone.  They set up an elaborate plan to get it.  Hanssen will go to the photographer to get his photo on the 25 years of service wall.   Meanwhile, Eric will grab the device, copy it and return it to Hanssen’s office.    The plan does not go smoothly, because Hanssen gets upset with the “faggit” photographer and nearly storms back into the office while Eric is copying the data.  Garcia saves the day by bringing Hanssen to the shooting range.

The FBI plans to sweep Hanssen’s car for any possible information.  They plan to sweep the car by completely taking it apart while Hanssen is in a meeting.    They are shocked to find the arsenal of guns in the trunk.  When the meeting gets cancelled, the agents aren’t notified that Hanssen is on the way back until they have already disassembled the car.  Eric tries to delay Hanssen’s return by getting them stuck in a traffic jam.  Frustrated, Hanssen gets out of the car and begins to walk home.  Eric stops him by telling him that he and Julianna are having problems and that he needs religious advice.

Eric gets a package from Hanssen and watches it, shocked to find out that it’s a homemade porno made by Hanssen.  Julianna catches Eric watching it.  She is livid.   
 Eric immediately tells Kate that he has threatened the case – his wife has found out. Kate tells him good news, the case is almost over, they think that Hanssen is going to make a drop.    As the surveillance team scopes out a park waiting for Hanssen to drop a lawn and leaf bag with confidential documents for Russian spies, another bombshell is dropped: a decoded message from Hanssens’ palm pilot has a recorded message of Hanssen saying that he is retiring as a spy.  They are no longer able to catch him red-handed.  

An agent comes in and tells Eric that Hanssen is parked outside his apartment.  Eric rushes home.  He thinks he can convince Hanssen to make the drop.  Hanssen is drunk.  He tells Eric that he wants to take him shooting.  They get in a big fight.   Eric tells Hanssen “you don’t matter!”  Hanssen makes the drop, and gets arrested.  “Pray for me,” is the last thing he ever says to Eric.

COMMENTS

A taut, well written script with wonderful dialog and exquisite details.  The story is compelling throughout, combining espionage with a wonderful character study of AGENT HANSSEN, which will be a great role for the wonderful Mr. Cooper.  With a strong performance by Ryan Philippe, this could be a great movie.  Mr. Ray directed another movie about a recent true story, SHATTERED GLASS, which featured a protagonist equally deceptive and manipulative.  BREACH seems like a logical next move for Mr. Ray, and his script certainly indicates that the film will be successful.  The main characters of Agents O’Neill and Hanssen dominate the script, and the rest of the ensemble may be lacking in depth or development, but the drama and tension between these two men is so palpable that I think it makes up for any weaknesses (of which there are not many) in the script.

COMMENTS

Well written with realistic characters whom one feels empathetic towards.  There are definitely a few heartbreaking moments, (particularly when they tell their loved ones they are leaving Palestine, and even more brutally, the scene where MUNA realizes that she has lost her life savings while trying to sneak it through customs).  Amreeka is one of those well drawn humanistic stories where even the antagonists have a believable point of view and dont come across as villainous, but the script’s story didn’t feel very fresh – its too recent to be a period piece, and too dated to be showing us something new;  first time director – not a prebuy.

An ex-con reluctantly drives his dying father cross country, surviving by using every scam and con available, while trying to mend their broken relationship.

COMMENTS

The cast is the most interesting aspect of this dull, one joke comedy (Christopher Walken is really cheap!) that has a slowly developing plot full of one “roadside attraction” (as we former film students call it) after another.  Some of the scams are amusing, but I hesitate to call any of them downright funny.  The scenes with EVE the trapper as well as the wedding cake bake off are absurd and over the top.  There’s an underlying charm that holds the thing together, but I still think it’s a pass.  It’s broad and slapsticky, but still weak for popcorn audiences. 


SUMMARY

FLYNN, a mid 20s health inspector, who’s recently broken up with his girlfriend, drearily performs his job, inspecting local eateries, nitpicking for health violations like dirty utensils, employee cleanliness and meat temperature.  After getting into an argument with a snooty restaurant manager, Flynn explodes, and flips out, disrupting everyone’s meal by screaming at the top of his lungs. 

MAGGIE, Flynn’s ex girlfriend comes to the apartment and expresses an interest in getting back together.  Flynn promises to change his grouchy, kid hating ways, but after she gets a phone call from his father NAT, Maggie gets angry with Flynn for lying about his past (his first name is Bobby, rather than Flynn, he’s been in jail, little white lies).  Nat tells Flynn that he’s dying, “I need to see you ASAP,” so  Flynn scams a cross country ticket and visits his father in Maryland.

Nat is the king of all cheapskates, he doesn’t have a job, lives in a crappy tiny apartment and survives on 5 dollars a day by performing all sorts of scams, ranging from collecting corporate thievery, to breaking and entering and grand larceny.  Nat convinces Flynn to drive him across country, promising to pay the entire way.  He is dying of a brain tumor and wants to go to an Indian healer outside of Seattle, thinking its his last hope. 

During the trip, Flynn gets exasperated very quickly with his conniving father, and argues with him about the fact that Flynn went to jail because of a crime Nat committed (something that he has still not forgotten or forgiven.) Nat’s “five star accommodations” were an exaggeration, in reality, they sneak into unsold houses, eat free birthday dinners at participating Denny’s chains and snag comp breakfasts from Motels. 

Nat takes them to the home of one of Flynn’s childhood babysitters, DOLORES, an early forties blond who’s still very attractive, and is interested in sleeping with Flynn.  Much to Nat’s chagrin, Flynn turns her down.  “Who the hell turns down free tail?” Flynn is shocked to learn that his mother actually left Nat for another man, KRUGER, the local car baron.  Flynn spent his entire life resenting Nat and believing that Nat had driven her away, rather than vice versa.   

Back on the road, father and son begin to run into trouble. Nat crashes a wedding and nearly gets them arrested when he destroys the cake, but Flynn saves the day by whipping up a gourmet cake made of twinkies.  They spend the night in an abandoned cabin, but in the mourning a huge female trapper EVE holds a crossbow to their heads, accusing them of breaking into her cabin and threatening to kill them if Flynn doesn’t have sex with her.  Nat volunteers for the job, and though he struggles to get it up and accidentally burns off her hair, the two have a great time. 

Flynn is finally starting to lighten up and enjoy himself. When they get to Idaho, Nat disappears, “I need some time by myself.” Flynn follows him and realizes that Nat is at Kruger’s car showroom.  Nat tells Kruger that Flynn is his son and threatens to reveal this info to Kruger’s new family.  He extorts Kruger for 150 grand in cash. 

Nat tells Flynn about his scam, but Flynn reacts strangely, and wonders if Kruger, could in fact, be his father. “Just because it was fake doesn’t mean it cant be true.”  Flynn visits Kruger.  The old man is nice and offers Flynn a job, but his attitude and his disparaging comments about Nat upset Flynn.  Flynn announces to the entire family that he is Kruger’s illegitimate ex con kid, and runs off.  

Flynn and Nat shred the DNA test that proves the paternity of Flynn, because Flynn doesn’t care who his real father is, he finally loves Nat. Nat dies of a brain tumor, leaving a lovely cabin and boat to his son.  Flynn gets back together with his pregnant girlfriend and spreads Nat’s ashes in the ocean.

LOGLINE

A romantic drama about a brief, unexpected love affair that catches two people completely off-guard. 

COMMENTS

Slow moving love story for the older Arthouse set, the growing feelings between Clarkson and Siddiq is well depicted, its a mature, intelligent story.  I haven’t seen any of the directors previous films, but I think this is a small arthouse pic without a ton of commercial potential.  Not a prebuy.

SUMMARY

... the woman, JULIETTE is married and travels to Egypt to visit her husband in the UN, but he’s too busy to meet her, and, as planned, take her to the pyramids, so he entrusts her company to his lifelong friend, a coffee shop owner, former UN employee and Cairo native, TARIQ who shows her around his city.  Though tradition, friendship and a loyalty keep the two apart, they become enamored of each other as Tariq shows her more and more of the city, even taking her to a local marriage (of the daughter of his old flame)  Juliette eventually caves in and lets Tariq take her to the pyramids,  a magical experience that the two share, and one that nearly leads tehm to consummating their growing love, but just at the moment it seems they may give in to their feelings, Juliette’s husband arrives.

Did you guys see the doc Young at Heart? I definitely think they got the idea from that.

It is a classic set up for a tearjerker. Angry, moody, controlling husband/father. Dying wife/mother. Touchy ending with angry husband/father finally getting it. The device they used to soften his heart (music) is great for a film. Like Mama Mia, it will make audiences smile.

I liked it. The writing is good. It succeeds in doing what it is set out to do. Make you laugh and cry. But, it's not a masterpiece.

This is still not a film for audience under 30 I think, but that doesn't need to be a bad thing, it just means that the price can't be too high. I could compare it with films like Calendar Girls, Away From Her and Young at Heart. It's really the dramatic version of Young at Heart. For the right price, this could be very interesting.

A black comedy about two 19th century grave robbers who find a lucrative business providing cadavers for an Edinburgh medical school.

COMMENTS:
The synopsis doesn’t really capture the humor of the story; it’s quite funny, a dark, British style humor with a strong story and interesting characters.  As of my reading there was no cast info, and Landis hasn’t directed a film in over a decade, so its too early for prebuy at this stage.  Nevertheless, it’s a funny smarthouse comedy in a screwball vein, allowing for some witty dialog and a lot of potential physical humor, particularly in the sequences where Burke and Hare are killing their victims.  The script juggles perhaps one or two too many subplots and the final act drags a bit long, but this is worth reading and tracking. 

SUMMARY:
Edinburgh, 1827. The world’s center for “anatomical research,” or, the study of the insides of the human body, in laymen’s terms. Medical students the world over come to Scotland to witness two famous doctors perform dissections; PROF ALEXANDER MONRO, a middle aged brutish man who hacks his way through bodies with a saw, and DR. KNOX, a much more crowd pleasing surgeon who does public dissections to great applause. Both men are in competition for fresh bodies to perform their surgeries, but can only legally obtain the bodies of those dead by execution.  

BURKE & HARE, two down on their luck con men, happen upon this budding business opportunity when they are forced to dispose of the dead body of Hare’s tenant OLD DONALD, which they sell to KNOX for 8 shillings. 

They decide to find more bodies by digging them up in the graveyard;  BURKE is uneasy, but Hare’s wife LUCKY has been haranguing him about money and he’s willing to try anything.  SGT. MCKLINTOCK, a local authority in charge of squelching grave robbery, catches them in the act and BURKE gets shot in the rear end while running away. 

BURKE and HARE return to the boarding house run by Hare and his wife, to find that JOSEPH, another old tenant, is on death’s doorstep.  HARE smothers the man with a pillow.

Excited, and flush with money, Burke and Hare sneak into an exclusive party where BURKE meets the beautiful Can-Can girl GINNY, who dreams of putting on an all female version of Macbeth and seems to think that BURKE can be one of her investors. 

At the party, LORD HARRINGTON announces a medical competition to win a Royal Seal;  both MUNRO and KNOX are determined to be victorious, and Knox shocks Munro with the news that he plans to “map the human body, both inside and out.” 

HARE closes a deal with KNOX to provide one body a week for a princely sum of money, but BURKE is again concerned, “how on God’s green earth are we going to find a fresh corpse every week?”  Hare convinces his friend to join him in killing bums and the two find themselves in business, killing their first by literally scaring the bum to death. 

Hare’s wife Lucky finds out about their scam and is actually happy, “it’s the smartest thing you’ve ever done,” but demands a “marriage tax” of one pound per body.   Meanwhile, Burke, though uneasy about its origins, happily begins spending his money; he takes GINNY out to a fancy new restaurant and offers to fund her production of Macbeth.  Burke’s largess draws the attention of local gangster OSHEA who threatens the duo and forces them to give him fifty percent of their profits. 

While Burke and Hare kill more and more, GINNY begins putting up the play, draining BURKE of most of his newfound wealth; but he’s happy to oblige, especially after GINNY finally kisses him. 

KNOX presents his preliminary work to LORD HARRINGTON; the first ever photographs of the human body, and the Lord is highly impressed, indicating that if Knox finishes, he will win not only a royal seal, but a possible Knighthood.  MUNRO is jealous and believes that Knox has been obtaining the bodies through nefarious means. 

MCKLINTOCK begins investigating the rash of mysterious deaths; GINNY’s play nears its premiere, and gangster OSHEA gets greedy and decides that he’s going to take over BURKE and HARE’s business.  Hare kills him and sells the body to Knox. 

The show premieres and is a smash hit.  McClintock arrests KNOX’s photographer and confiscates all the photos of the deceased as evidence.  KNOX divulges that Burke and Hare provided the bodies.   Burke, Hare, Ginny and Lucky are arrested. 

In order to save the lives of Lucky, Ginny and Hare, Burke confesses to the murders. He gets hanged for the crimes. 

Hare opens a funeral parlor and is a great success.   Burke’s bones are put on display at the Royal College in Edinburgh, labeled as “the most evil man in Scotland.”

",,,,,,,"LOGLINE:
Effie Gray is a charming and naïve young girl trapped in a loveless marriage to one of the great English intellectuals, JOHN RUSKIN. Craving emotional and physical attention, she falls in love with the dashing artist JOHN EVERETT MILLAIS. In an historic and extraordinary twist, Effie wins a landmark ruling by successfully divorcing Ruskin on the grounds that their marriage was never consummated. “Effie” is the entertaining and repressive true story of one of the great scandals of the Victorian era.

COMMENTS: 

Script follows EFFIE, trapped in a loveless marriage to JOHN RUSKIN, who is portrayed as a strong villainous character; and her love affair with MILIUS is powerful and rings true.   Story is a bit stodgy, however, and lacks the craftsmanship of Sense & Sensibility. There are a few really fun smaller characters, including most notably: Lady East Lake.  Script has potential but falls a bit short, and indeed is a bit forgettable. Worth reading, but I don’t see it rising to an awards level project.  

SHORT SUMMARY

EFFIE GRAY has a strange relationship with the older poet JOHN RUSKIN, with whom she shares a seemingly mutual attraction.  When she is of age, she marries him. 

Instantly, the marriage seems doomed; EFFIE and JOHN move into his parents’ estate, “you’ll never want for money again,” but his parents MR and (the awful) MRS RUSKIN live there as well, and MRS RUSKIN seems to hate EFFIE off the bat.  To make matters worse, JOHN doesn’t seem that passionate about his new wife. 

At an ART opening, EFFIE meets the glorious LADY EASTLAKE, a high upper crust stalwart of society, and MILLAIS a younger artist who shares an instant attraction with EFFIE. 

The couple take a trip to Venice, where EFFIE nearly has a sexual awakening, flirting with an Italian RAFAEL, and he nearly forces himself on her. JOHN is oblivious. 

Their relationship gets worse and worse, MRS RUSKIN literally drugging the sickly EFFIE with laudanum until a doctor puts a stop to it and reprimands JOHN for being so oblivious; “there’s nothing wrong with your wife that a little love and a keener eye wont help.”  He recommends she recuperate in Scotland. 

In Scotland, MILLAIS is commissioned to do a painting of JOHN. MILLAIS’ flirtation with EFFIE increases, under JOHN’s nose, unbeknownst to him. MILLAIS is frankly offended by JOHN’s comportment in her regard: “When you have been married as 
long as I have, Everett, you will no longer be surprised by my indifference, but rather at my patience in supporting someone so...unhappily diseased...” John Laments. 

John eventually gets suspicious. The marriage gets even worse.  LADY EASTLAKE is shocked to hear that EFFIE and JOHN have never had sex, and hires a lawyer who annuls the marriage due to John’s impotency.  

A year later, EFFIE and MILLAIS marry and have eight children.

COVERAGE:
I like the script. I think it has potential, but only for a very small price. I am not sure if this director can pull off a Theatrical film. But with Mary J. Blidge in the role, there is certainly value (her fans and Nina's fans).  There is definitely a nice relationship between the two. It all depends on the director, if she can pull it onto the screen. I wish the script would have given more insight, details about the child she abandoned. But that is just my personal interest. The story is sad, but yet has hope. It could be a very good film. I still think that unless you get it for a good price, you should wait to see some scenes. I liked it a lot, but didn't love it.

 An aspiring young saxophonist who discovers an unopened love letter hidden in the cover of a long lost Bossa Nova record - its author a great Brazilian artist.  Determined to deliver the letter to the mysterious 'Hannah', Nick's search unravels a profound love story that takes us back to the cool clubs of Rio de Janeiro and the burgeoning and seductive Bossa Nova scene of the 1960's.
 
 
COMMENTS 
I read a draft of this two years ago; and this one seems even thinner and less substantial; the love story (which is really between GEORGE and HANNAH rather than NELSON and Hannah, which is a fairly sly trick that I enjoyed) is pretty small and way too much time is spent following the boring lead NICK’s quest to discover the truth about the song. Coupling that with the oddity of having it be an actual MUSICAL (ie, characters intermittently break into song) and this reads as a very weak piece.   Pass. 
 
SUMMARY 
A record collector, NICK, discovers are rare recording from a Brazilian  BOSA NOVA musician/ political activist NELSON DO MOROW, who was disappeared by the Brazilian government in 1968.   The record sleeve contains a letter to a HANNAH, and Nick takes it upon himself to begin investigating who the woman may be. 
 
The movie intercuts with footage from RIO in the sixties that shows HANNAH in the midst of a love triangle; she's a teacher and piano virtuoso who has moved to Brazil to play music for six months. She has feelings for one of her bandmates, GEORGE, but before boarding the plane, she gets engaged to the practical guy, her boyfriend CHARLES.  
 
In Rio, Hannah is moved by the exciting new music of the Bosa Nova. 
 
in NYC / 2008, Nick meets MILLER, the record producer who recorded the song, but he's gone senile, and only gives NICK one lead, the phrase, 'MINOR KEY!'  A record collector offers NICK 15 grand for the rare record. 
 
1961. GEORGE takes HANNAH out and they watch Nelson play BOSSA NOVA. She has a blast; and George tells her that he loves her. 
 
Hannah inspires Nelson to write a song; he writes a love song, the song Nick finds three decades later. 
 
PRESENT: Nick finds Hannah, who tells him that Nelson had not written her a love song, that his song insprited her to find her own way in life. 

FB Hannah gives Charles his ring back and runs off with George. 
 
Nick is finally able to pick up his horn and start playing again.

COMMENTS
This is an above-average, feel-good, underdog script.  I was pre-disposed not to like it as it is a story we know yet this one has a lot of heart as well as a lot of action.  Writing is very good as are characters, and this is MUCH less sentimental than OPAL DREAM.  Story has its ups and downs with laughs along the way.  It is a good family film that should provide entertainment for adults and kids.  Kids in the story are under 12 so it is really for that audience, plus there is a nice budding adult romance which rounds things out a bit.  Act 3 has a lot of action and emotion which for me make this effective.  The adult leads have not been cast yet and Ealing is looking for pre-sale partners as they cast.  Not sure if this is entirely cast-dependent, however, if they get the adult leads right, this certainly will have much more broad appeal.  My worry is that this story focuses on hockey – there is a big tournament in Canada where we meet teams from the Czech Republic, Germany and France yet is this going to have resonance in most territories?  The film is not about hockey per se – it is really about what it means to be a team and in the same sense, what it means to be a family.  Hockey is just an action-packed back drop to tell the story.  As a family film I can certainly recommend this one, once we hear about the cast.  Think it is one for MW to weigh in on though.

Four GIA terrorists hijack an Air France A300 Airbus at Algiers airport. The Airbus, bound for Paris, has 227 passengers on board. No one knows exactly what the terrorists’ intentions are, just that they are armed and extremely determined. They demand the liberation of their “brothers in arms” and want the aircraft to take off at once.

A straightforward account of a 1994 terrorist attack against an Air France flight departing from Algiers.
 
COMMENTS
 It’s a good story; and the fact based accounting of it is exciting but a touch clinical. The final gun fight is gruesome, intense and very realistic; it seems like a very similar project to Greengrass’ Flight 97 and begs the question, are audiences interested in watching a film about this topic?  I also think it’s largely going to appeal only to territories with French Speaking/ French interest… I recall the event only slightly and think that internationally it’s obviously been over shadowed by more recent events, hence there is perhaps not enough curiosity about it.   In terms of the script specifically, I think it’s a bit sleight, it reads like a Gaghan type thriller that takes a look at the incident through a prism of multiple, intercutting storylines, but I never felt that it delivered – CAROLE & ALI TOUCHENT’s involvement are fairly slight, and the subplot about THIERRY’s wife felt overwrought. (There are several scenes of her nervously watching the television broadcast of the events)  Script has merit; indie circle should look at it. Others, no.
 
SUMMARY (combined from Elle Driver’s provided notes and my read)
Saturday 24th December 1994.
Four GIA terrorists hijack an Air France A300 Airbus at Algiers airport. The Airbus, bound for Paris, has 227 passengers on board.  The Algiers government holds the plane on the tarmac, refusing to detach the boarding stairs, and the terrorists retaliate by killing four hostages before the stairs are finally detached and the plane allowed to leave. The plane flies to France and stops over, the terrorists clearly planning to refuel and crash the “flying bomb” into Paris;
 
There are three main characters at the heart of the action:  Thierry Prugnaud, a member of the GIGN, Carole Jeanton, an ambitious technocrat willing to go to any lengths to achieve personal gain from the events, and Yahia Abdallah, a determined jihadist who grew up in the slums of Algiers and was being manipulated by an obscure GIA envoy, Ali Touchent.
 
The French government, including CAROLE, suspects as that the terrorists will try to crash the plane, and a preemptive attack is prepared. The GIGN (like SWAT) board the plane on the tarmac and a massive firefight ensues; all of the terrorists are killed and the rest of the hostages manage to get out alive. 
 
In front of an audience of 21 million television viewers, an assault by the GIGN brings the hostage crisis to an end.   Thierry is shot eight times but survives.

In Columbia, a troubled conductor whose girlfriend has recently disappeared begins an affair with a barmaid who notices eerie phenomena in the conductor's house. They are the work of the missing girlfriend, who has trapped herself in the bunker built by house's architect, a former Nazi, from which she is watching the conductor's affair. The barmaid deciphers what has happened – but wants the conductor for herself.  

COMMENTS 
Columbian director Andres Baiz' debut film, Satanas, was well received and I've little doubt that he will shoot Bunker in a stylish manner. But the script is slight and dissatisfying – and I don't think much was lost in the translation.  

The characters are too little developed for this to be considered a psychological thriller. The faux-supernatural phenomena and the slight possibility that Adrian has disposed of Belen produce only mild suspense. And while Belen's predicament is dramatic and the reiteration from her perspective of what we saw in the first half of the script is interesting, the conclusion is not a satisfying; none of the psychological or ethical issues raised by events have been addressed.  

Rather more problematic, given the genre, is that the story trades upon our registering specific elements – the key; Fabiana talking into the sink, etc.-- that will developed in some significant way. But the script is full of story elements that are emphasized but not developed, the most obvious being the extensive Nazi references, none or which prove relevant in any way.
 
This is not sophisticated screenwriting and I can't see Bunker having much Popcore potential. 

SUMMARY  
Unkempt and adrift, ADRIAN, the 40 year old Barcelonian conductor of the Bogota Philharmonic, returns from rehearsal to a huge house which is empty except for a huge Doberman pinscher, HANS. Restless, he fills the bathroom sink, washes his face and leaves the house without seeing the rhythmic waves breaking, seemingly without source or cause, the stagnant water in the sink. 

At a nearby bar, Adrian drinks and flirts with a barmaid, FABIANA, whose attraction to Adrian is not diminished by the warnings from her jealous ex-lover, RAMIREZ, a policeman that the conductor's girlfriend recently disappeared. When Adrian passes out, Fabiana drives him home. She is stunned by the size of the house – and the disorder of the master bedroom. Putting the conductor to bed, Fabiana cleans the room. She finds a smashed camera and a long artifact that looks like a key.  

The two begin an affair and Fabaina moves in for the two weeks of her vacation. After Adrian leaves the next morning, Fabiana tries to shower but the water repeatedly turns scalding. Searching Adrian's bedroom, she finds the smashed camera. It is clearly the property of his missing girlfriend, BELEN, who has left on it a video message to Adrian that the broken camera cannot clearly play.  Adrian catches Fabiana with the camera but his anger quickly passes.  

As Ramirez and his partner search the house for clues as to Belen's possible whereabouts,  Fabiana  wonders whether Belen is dead. Adrian insists, not for the first time, that she has left him for someone else. And he dismisses the things that make Fabiana fear the house is haunted: the scalding water in the shower, the distant wailing sound through the faucet, the lights suddenly going off.... 

Adrian is called to identify a body that might be Belen’s. On returning from an exhausting visit to the morgue with the hostile Ramirez, Adrian finds Fabiana talking into the bathroom sink. The jealous Fabiana is clearly disappointed to hear that the deceased woman was not Belen but Adrian tells her that while he loved Belen, he is no longer with her.  

And then we are in Barcelona, months earlier. We see Adrian and Belen together and her ambivalence about going with him when he is offered a six month position leading the Bogota orchestra. In Columbia, she sees Adrian flirting with a young violinist and jokingly warns him not to be surprised if he wakes one morning and she is gone.  

Belen visits a house for them to rent: the house on the hill. The owner, 85 year RUTH HONEKER, is returning to Germany for the first time since she left it in 1945 and whoever rents the house must care for her Doberman, Hans. The dog takes an immediate liking to Belen. Deciding to share a secret with   Belen, Ruth takes her to the master bedroom. She inserts the key-like artifact into a hole in the bedroom's mirrored wall and the wall opens to reveal a bunker. Ruth's late husband, also named Hans, was an architectural engineer who worked for the Nazi's. He built the house and, because he feared “they” would come looking for him, the bunker. Completely sealed off, with two-way mirrors looking into the bedroom and, at the other end, the bathroom, and a speaker to listen into those rooms, the bunker is impregnable and can only be entered with the key.  

Adrian and Belen move into the house. Feeling Adrian is neglecting her, Belen decides to test his affection. With her camera she records a video message to Adrian, telling him that she met someone new and is leaving. As Adrian arrives home, Belen closes herself in the bunker, not noticing that the key has fallen from her pocket. Watching through the mirror, Belen has the pleasure of seeing Adrian's anguished response to her video goodbye – a pleasure which turns to panic when she realizes she doesn't have the key. Only Hans, the loyal Doberman senses that Belen is behind the mirror.  

Tormented, Belen watches Adrian's affair with Fabiana. The ripples in the bathroom sink are Belen beating on the other side of the bathroom mirror. The lamenting sound is Belen yelling into the bunker's broken toilet. Belen scalds Fabiana in the shower by turning a red lever – a lever which breaks, causing water to gush into the bunker.   

After Adrian leaves for the morgue, Belen is startled to see Fabiana fill the sink and carefully observe the water. Fabiana, frightened at first, asks “yes” and “no” questions, which Belen answers by causing the ripples it indicate “yes.” Fabiana figures out that Belen is behind the mirror and that the key-like artifact is in fact a key. She is about to open the bunker but first asks if Belen still loves Adrian. Seeing the ripples, Fabiana says, “Then we have nothing more to discuss – because I love him to.” Just then Adrian returns from the morgue. Furious and despairing, Belen destroys the speaker that allows her to hear the outside world. 

But Fabiana is anxious. She moves all of Adrian's things to the guest room, saying that the bathroom is better there. She presses the noncommittal conductor to take him with her when he returns to Spain. She fills bathroom sink to contact Belen but gets no response. Belen is too weak to bang on the mirror. 

As the water rises, the delirious Belen reads in Hans' diary of how he, dying in this bunker, felt himself become a part of it. 

Fabiana finally opens the bunker. Water spills out as she enters the dark room and when she reaches to take Belen's pulse, Belen knocks her unconscious with a bottle.  
Adrian returns home and, urged on by Hans, goes to the master bedroom. Entering the bunker, he finds Fabiana – as Belen, in the bedroom, closes the bunker's door on the pair.

SUMMARY
The film portrays the story of an unusual friendship. A boy with a troubled childhood and a young man with a broken life both have one thing in common: nobody needs them. Thomas struggles to fit to society. Labeled as a “freak” he keeps ending up in a psychiatry. The younger Ukrainian boy Viktor counts as a nuisance to everyone and is set to go to an orphanage after the death of his mother. 

After finding each other, however, they build a small cabin in the woods to establish their own home within nature. Their daily struggle for survival creates a strong bond between the two and gives their life a new meaning. The nature provides them with new strength and they are no longer the “freaks” they once were. Now they are the ones who look down upon the daily routines of the matrix instead of vice-versa.

This despite the public outrage in Israel, and despite his mother regarding his actions as an act of betrayal. Max always maintains that Germany - where he was born before the war and where his father was taken away by the Gestapo - means nothing to him, and that training their national team is just another job on his path to NBA glory. But things aren’t as simple as Max pretends them to be. The only person he seems to be able to relate to is a Turkish immigrant woman, Deniz, and her cheeky teenage daughter Sema. Max develops a complicated relationship with the two while he succeeds in reinventing the German team despite resistance from the players.

LOGLINE

A biopic based on the life and romances of Amelia Earhart, the famed aviator and pioneer of female rights. 

COMMENTS

A clunky voice over and rigid adherence to stereotypes of the genre hinder this otherwise interesting biopic.  The tone is a bit too corny, but Amelia’s character is very nuanced and subverts expectations.  While Earhart is a legend to this day, she’s a celebrity from before the days of rampant tv coverage, so she remains something of an enigma.  The script appealed to my curiousity about Earhart, I was engaged by the story and interested throughout.  Unfortunately, the similarity to the recent AVIATOR film by Scorsese is a negative, and the period stuff might scare away some audiences.  A popcorn biopic with a good part for Swank, this is decent but tough for a prebuy. 

SUMMARY

AMELIA EARHART is hired by GEORGE PUTNAM for a glorified publicity stunt: she will be the “commander” of a cross Atlantic flight, ostensibly becoming the first female to ever accomplish that feat.  Amelia is involved in a rivalry with MABEL BELL, another female aviator who competes to beat Amelia to the punch.  When Earhart gets word that Bell plans to fly the following day, Earhart goes against her pilot BILL STULTZ’s advice and orders that they depart.  The crew nearly dies because of the weather, but land successfully in the waters just off the shore of Wales and Amelia Earhart becomes an instant international celebrity.  Amelia’s relationship with Putnam gets more serious, until a full blown affair results in his divorce from his first wife.  Putnam marries Amelai, but she insists that he never expect her to be loyal, claiming that she knows her nature runs against the concept of monogamy.  Putnam, deeply in love, agrees to marry anyhow.  Earhart’s status as top female aviator relies on increasing publicity stunts including a rigged “powder puff” race of female pilots, and a solo cross atlantic trip, that Amelia partakes to prove to herself that she is a real pilot.  Amelia nearly dies during the flight, narrowly avoiding several mechanical disasters and crashes, but winds up landing in a French farm.  Amelia’s relationship with Putnam sours when she falls for Aviation tycoon GENE VIDAL (Gore’s Father).  Gene gets sick of Amelia’s relentless self promotion and risk taking and Amelia returns to the arms of Putnam just in time to plan a monumental adventure : an airborne circumnavigation of the globe.  The trip is insanely risky because the leg from Hawaii to Asia is too far to refuel.  Vidal suggests that Earhart refuel on a tiny island in the pacific, but the plan fails… Earhart’s plane disappears.

A father struggles to bond with his estranged son Gabriel after Gabriel suffers from a brain tumor that prevents him from forming new memories.  With Gabriel unable to shed the beliefs and interests that caused their physical and emotional distance, Henry must learn to embrace his son’s choices and connect with him through music.

COMMENTS
A touching story, especially the end.  Can feel a little fragmented, and sometimes scenes seem to be more illustrative of a character’s condition than actually driving the story along. The conflicts between father and son in flashbacks are very typical Vietnam-era kid vs. stodgy WWII father.  However, there are moments of humor and exhilaration and the roles of Henry and Gabriel could both be vehicles for strong performances.  Not a definite buy but might be worth considering further.

SUMMARY
The film opens in 1968 in New York’s Greenwich Village as a young dancing hippie, GABRIEL, slowly collapses.  It is now 1986, and HENRY and HELEN receive a call from the hospital.  They learn that GABRIEL, their long-estranged son, had actually been living on the streets, his memory damaged by a large brain tumor.  When his tumor is removed and he wakes up, he has no short-term memory and is incapable of forming new long-term memories.  HENRY and HELEN are shattered, but find moments of encouragement when GABRIEL can interact with people, usually with advertising jingles or rhymes.  When a nurse gives GABRIEL a radio to help him sleep, GABRIEL plays the Marseillaise (also the opening to “All You Need Is Love”) on his trumpet.  In a series of flashbacks we see GABRIEL moving from a sweet boy to a rebellious teenager.  He is a musician, and though undeniably talented, his political views and cultural tastes conflict drastically with HENRY’s generational mindset.  

HENRY loses his job at Eastman/Kodak and seeks out DIANNE DALY, a professor investigating the brain’s connection to music.  DIANNE agrees to help GABRIEL, but when she plays the music that HENRY gives her, it elicits a negative response.  Realizing that GABRIEL was starting to play a Beatles song on the trumpet, not the Marseillaise, DIANNE plays rock music from the 60’s and GABRIEL responds amazingly well.  GABRIEL begins to relate his own memories of his conflicts with his father, especially the night when a U.S. flag was burned at his gig and his father kicked him out of the house.

HENRY expresses his anger and his belief that GABRIEL was corrupted by rock music but relents after HELEN decides to sleep elsewhere.  HENRY trades all his old jazz records in and buys rock music from the 60’s to play for GABRIEL. GABRIEL seems much more himself when talking about music and is improving in general, even flirting with a girl who works at the hospital café.

HENRY and GABRIEL listen to more and more Grateful Dead, and HENRY, despite a heart attack, wins Dead tickets from a local radio station.  As GABRIEL’s mental facilities slowly improve, he becomes depressed over the type of life he has, especially after meeting an old girlfriend while home for Christmas.  HENRY and GABRIEL go to the Dead concert and have a great time.  They connect with each other and manage to leave the past behind.  They hear a new Dead song, “Touch of Grey” that GABRIEL is excited about.  The film ends at HENRY’s funeral, later that year.  He has asked that his favorite song be played, and during “Touch of Grey”, we see that GABRIEL remembers the concert and can cry for his father.

COMMENTS:
This is an interesting story in that it is not a kid’s story, but it is not an adult drama either. The fact that it is about a dog, yet not geared toward children, makes it difficult to consider. It feels like a book adaptation (it is) and I was constantly wondering whether everything felt fleshed out enough for me. I could never really pin down the authors voice as the story moved in different directions and doesn’t have a true narrator. We are constantly shifiting between characters as the story is told, and I think that the director will have trouble making this into a cohesive film. There is no central character and we are made to believe that it is the dog who is the protagonist, yet I never really got that feeling. There lacks the adventure and sense of personality that makes other children’s movies about animals successful. The story is not a heartwarming one about family and love and sense of home – and in many ways it doesn’t try to be. This makes it interesting, but leaves it with no built in audience and I was constantly wondering who is going to see this?


SUMMARY:
Thomas’s truck bumps along a dirt road. He stops, gets out, and looks at his map – he is lost. Headlights come up behind him and a car passes him at high speed. He continues on the road, arriving at the eerily quiet Mermaid hotel, which is deserted. Thomas walks to the bar and through an open door, catches a glimpse of a group of men holding something down with a gun pointed at it – Red Dog, who is very sick and likely on his last legs. 

Jack, the owner of the bar, gets Thomas a drink, and begins to tell the tale of the legendary Red Dog. We see a great deal of the story through flashbacks.

Jack picks up Red Dog as he and his wife Maureen are driving into a mining town in Dampier. They are looking for some good quick money so they can reach their dream of owning a bar. They come across Red Dog, sitting in the middle of the road, “hitch hiking.” They all ride into town.

Back to present day at the pub: the vet arrives, townspeople gather, worrying about Red Dog. Thomas is introduced to Vanno, an Italian immigrant who cant stop talking about the little village where he is from. He explains that he came here for money, but the heat will kill a man. We see a flashback of a car exploding, the gas tank igniting in the sun. Vanno goes on about Red Dog.

Flashback: Red Dog has now made himself at home among the community of miners. He is walking around the men’s mess hall, all different nationalities together. We are now at the bar on Friday night. Red Dog makes himself welcome surrounded by rowdy miners. We meet Peeto with and handlebar mustache and Jocko, the only one unfazed by the wildness around him. Fighting and all out mayhem is a daily occurrence. 

Vanno is reminiscing about his home in Abruzzi and nobody wants to hear it. They all threaten to beat him up. Jocko is not homesick saying, “you need a home to be homesick.” The next day, Vanno sees Red Dog playing, and decides to talk to him about his village. Red Dog is the only one who will listen.

Vanno catches Peeto talking to Red Dog, and thinks he has been betrayed, but they finally decide that nobody owns Red Dog, he belongs to everyone. The miners decide to make him a member of Local 53, their Union. 

Along comes John, a wanderer who has never lived in a place for more than two years. He rides into town on his motorcycle looking for work. He passes Red Dog and the two acknowledge each other – two lone travelers. John gets a job as a bus driver, but he wont let Red Dog on the bus. Everyone explains that Red Dog is a hitchhiker. Later that week, John gets on his bus and notices Red Dog in the seat beside him, ready for a ride. John kicks him off.

Its Saturday night and everyone is at the bar. A contest is going on to see how fast Red Dog can eat a variety of things. Red Dog is about to eat a live chicken when John steps in and says he wont let Red Dog eat a live chicken for everyone’s amusement. He calls for Red Dog, who follows him out of the bar. John is the only one Red Dog will answer to. Red Dog gets on the bus and they drive off.

One day, a woman who is new to town, Nancy, gets on the bus. It is full except for the seat with Red Dog on it. She tries to get the dog off, but with no luck. She decides they will share the seat. John and Nancy talk for a while, and John asks her out. John picks her up later at Cribbage Caravan Park, owned by the Cribbages and their nasty cat Red Cat. A sign says, no dogs allowed. The two go to a drive in theater to watch Jaws, but are interrupted by Red Dog, who has escaped Veeto who was watching him, and made his way to find his master. John asks Nancy if she wants to see a real shark, and they go to the cove where a giant tiger shark lives. They kiss.

In the morning, Red Dog comes in and sees that Nancy has spent the night. Red Dog looks at them curiously. Jocko explains that Red Dog was not so bad with the ladies either, and we see a montage of him humping other dogs.

We go to Caravan Park, where Red Dog enters the no dogs allowed area. He gets into it with Red Cat and Mrs. Cribbage comes out screaming at Red Dog to get lost. We find out that Mrs Cribbage shot Red Dog, and he needs to go to the vet. Peeto, Jocko, and Vanno take him and John to the vet, where Vanno falls in love with a nurse, Rose. Vanno decides he will take Red Dog back to the vet to get his stitches out so he can ask out Rose. He chickens out but eventually asks her out.

There is a montage of moments that Red Dog experienced with various townspeople, Jocko explaining that Red Dog saved him from the tiger shark, etc.

Thomas asks what ever happened to John, as he is not at the bar and Red Dog is dying. We flashback to John and Nancy getting engaged, and a large celebration follows. In the morning, John gets up and goes to work, kissing Nancy goodbye. We find out that John was killed on his motorcycle that morning. 

Red Dog waits patiently for his master to return, but he is never coming back. Red Dog sits on the porch for a week before he finally decides to get up and look for John. We see a montage of Red Dog crisscrossing the globe searching. He stops back in Dampier to visit Nancy and pay his respects, but he is now a lone traveler again, as John was. 

While visiting Nancy, Mrs Cribbage comes to warn her that the dog must go or else. Nancy gets the whole town together and they march up to Mrs Cribbage’s and tell her that Red Dog can come and go as he pleases. The police officer agrees. The Cribbages are so intimidated that they skip town. 

Everyone in the bar begins to sing as they remember the good times they had with Red Dog. Joy has erupted and they don’t notice Red Dog as he slips out of the bar and boards a train for one last journey.

LOGLINE

A gang war escalates when two life long friends face off, after NACCHIA hires men to kill CHARLY; CHARLY gets shot 22 times, but survives, and returns, looking for revenge. 

COMMENTS

Standard story, standard plotting, nothing we haven’t seen before on really any level, but the writing is good and the revenge sequences are cold blooded to the point of being a bit chilling; especially CHARLY’s birthday party hit, and the revenge killing that leaves a man lying dead on his own son’s grave.    I haven’t seen any of the directors previous films.  I think this is interesting for arthouse; I imagined it in the vein of a Mike Hodges movie (GET CARTER; I’LL SLEEP WHILE I’M DEAD) and like Reno returning to a role reminiscent of THE PROFESSIONAL; though this isn’t nearly as action packed.   Would be better to watch; and I don’t think its that interesting for popcorn territories.

SUMMARY 

A group of killers attack retired mob boss CHARLY MATTEI in a parking lot; shooting him 22 times and killing his dog as well.  CHARLY slumps to the ground but doesn’t die. 

CHARLY is taken to the hospital where he is placed under protective custody.  Cop MARIE tries to get him to talk, but he refuses to cooperate.  His recouperation is slow; while he is in the hospital, his old friend NACCHIA pays him a visit.  ZACCHIA promises to “find the bastards who did this.” 

A fink tells Charly that NACCHIA is behind the attempted hit, but CHARLY doesn’t want his crew to seek revenge. 

Rival gang members, thugs who work for NACCHIA, send a message to CHARLY; they kill KARIM, one of CHARLY’s most trusted men, and send one of his body parts to CHARLY’s house in the mail. 

CHARLY tells one of his gangsters, PAT, to take ANATOLE and CHRISTELLE out of the city.  “Marseilles is too dangerous.” 

CHARLY walks in to the middle of the rival gang’s birthday party and kills BASTIEN.  He tells the other gang members that he’s coming after them too, he’ll let them wait in fear.  “There will be no safe place for you as long as I live.” 

CHARLY kills the hitter PAPALARDO in a cemetery, leaving the dead man to lie on his own son’s grave. 

ZACCHIA is getting nervous and tries to bribe MARIE GOLDMAN, the cop, into helping protect him and catch CHARLY.  She refuses.

ZACCHIA sends hitter to CHARLY’s boat, but CHARLY escapes by crashing his own car into a cop car and drawing a crowd of police. 

CHARLY kills another one of the shooters, and captures RABOU, shooting the man in the foot. “Are you crazy???”  RABOU agrees to give CHARLY a bunch of information about ZACCHIA, the accounts info, contacts, bookkeeping about the gang’s drug dealing. CHARLY kills RABOU. 

MALEK gets killed (presumably by CHARLY) on his wedding night. 

The gang capture CHARLY’s son ANATOLE.  CHARLY convinces the cop MARIE to help him save his son’s life; She announces that the police have arrested CHARLY.  CHARLY secretly heads to find his son, knowing that ZACCHIA will have him killed as soon as he hears the news.  CHARLY kills his son’s captor and brings his son home safely. 

CHARLY finds out that the eighth shooter was his lifelong friend and lawyer BEAUDINARD. Charly takes BEAUDINARD to the very parking lot where he had been shot and fires his gun repeatedly, purposefully missing.  “We are now even.”

A decent script/plot. I don’t see a reason the pre-buy the film outside French speaking territories. It's a hard to watch story. Like watching a train wreck.

COMMENTS 
Starts off charming and clever and funny; I liked the premise about the arranged marriage and the Estonian ethnicity added a bit of BIG FAT GREEK WEDDING feel without feeling inauthentic, but eventually the characters just devolved into caricatures who spend half the movie yelling at each other.  Their quirks and arguments get simplified to a ridiculous level and their relationship got tiresome. B/C popcorn only.  Chick flick, so maybe females would like it more, but I wound up irritated.  Director has a successful record, so maybe it’s a piece of business, but if I recommended, my heart wouldn’t be in it.

SUMMARY 
BESS is dating a sensitive musician type, but he dumps her while her entire family is over, sending her into a depressed spiral that equals three weeks of crying and laying in bed. 

JAKE, meanwhile, a sports radio announcer, is getting tired of the single life, but no longer believes in love after having been dumped ten years ago by a cheating fiancée. 

BESS and JAKE are both Estonian and their parents, BESS’s mom and JAKE’s dad, meet a matchmaker RAFFIE, who puts the pair together.  BESS and JAKE are initially skeptical, but after they meet and hit it off during an Estonian street fare, they agree to get married. 

JAKE’s brother ADAM and BESS’s best friend RACHEL think the two are nuts and try to stop the wedding, but JAKE and BESS go through with it.  They get married and are totally happy, everything is going beautifully… but RACHEL insists that soon the bubble will burst; and it does.  JAKE’s strategic sex moves start to irritate BESS.  BESS’s sloppiness starts to irritate JAKE, and so on… pretty soon they are fighting all the time. 
 
BESS and JAKE decide they want a divorce, but their parents insist they try to work it out, and the pair reluctantly agree to make an effort. 

They have ups (she shows off and embarrasses his ex girlfriend) and downs (she finds out he didn’t mail in the marriage license), but mostly their differences wind up causing them to have a series of shouting matches. 

In a last ditch attempt to change, he goes to a Cubs game (she thinks he’s emotionally cut off because he refuses to watch his favorite team) and she tries to save her business by heading to Paris to meet investors, despite the fact that she’s deathly afraid of flying. 

JAKE’s wildly emotional behaviour at the game convinces his boss to give him a promotion, and JAKES flies their entire families to Paris where he gets on his knee and asks BESS to 'stay his wife.” She happily agrees.

COMMENTS: Script is above average, with great lessons and inspirational moments, but lacks a bit of comedy.  Similar to UP in storyline, and that it can also attract an older audience, but not as cute or funny.  The incorporation of Chopin's music should enhance the film, and visually I'm sure it will be stunning, but it lacks the fun, quirky nuances that children are usually drawn to.  Animation films like this rely heavily on over the top characters, and I didn't feel that, they felt a bit flat.  It also helps to have big name actors lending their voices to these types of films, Heather Graham isn't going to sell it alone.  I would wait on this, not an urgent pre-buy.  But it will be interesting to see how it takes shape on screen.

SYNOPSIS:
ANNA lives in Poland.  She's tired of having a mother who constantly ignores her, and she misses her father who now lives in London for work.  Anna and her little cousin CHIP CHIP see Lang Lang perform Chopin's compositions in concert, while Anna's mother spends the entire evening on her blackberry trying to close a deal on a home.

The next day, Anna finds a beat up old piano in a nearby junkyard.  She realizes that it levitates, and so she jumps on and starts up it's engine, Chip Chip jumps on and joins her for the ride.  It takes her over Paris and on to London, where she will soon visit her father.

Definitely one of the stronger horror pictures on the market right now, its smart, scary, and also emotional; the ONE drawback would be the period setting; it’s a stodgy, Merchant Ivory type setting, but the director insists in his statement that the style will be contemporary and thrilling; and he wants it to appeal to young audiences.  It’s far smarter than the average 3D script; and thankfully doesn’t rely on the medium to create the only thrills; there a half dozen really memorable, chilling scenes.  No cast yet. This one is worth considering; it skews a bit arthouse because of period and because the director is a bit more of a highbrow horror guy; but still, worth discussion across the board. Recommend.
 
 
SHORT SUMMARY 
 
Young lawyer Arthur Kipps leaves his son in London to settle the legal affairs of the recently deceased Alice Drablow. He discovers a series of inexplicable accidents and suicides have forced the parents of her village to barricade their children indoors, as if protecting them from an unseen foe.

When Arthur stays the night all alone at the Drablow’s foreboding house, he hears the screams of a drowning child and sees decaying children listlessly wandering the marshes. He will soon discover these haunting figures share the same date of death, and the same killer.

The ghost of a scorned woman, who was unable to save her beloved son Nathaniel from drowning, The Woman In Black takes on a horrifying form. Set on vengeance, her veil hides gaping sockets eaten away by scavengers and her curse hides an even darker secret … whenever she is seen, a child dies.

In the face of hostility from the local residents, Arthur dredges up Nathaniel’s skeleton and buries it with his mother, hoping the evil spectre will finally rest in peace. In a cruel twist of fate the The Woman In Black turns her claws toward Arthur’s young son. To avoid a fate worse than death, Arthur must now sacrifice everything he holds dear and save his child.

COMMENTS 
Feels really dated; would have been funnier if it were set / shot in the cold war era, the humor is a bit stale, feels toothless; TV / Video value but doesn’t feel theatrical.  The characters are silly, the plot thin, and the climactic chase / fight sequences aren’t very strong; the blimp sequence at the end is particularly cartoonish.  Will appeal to older audiences, Costner fans, etc, but this isn’t one to jump on as a prebuy.

SUMMARY 
CARL, an aging CIA spy, lives in a beautiful port town in Sicily.  He has been stationed there to spy on a crime boss, DON LUPANO, but the agency has such little interest that they haven’t replied to CARL’s secret transmissions in years.  CARL is in love with a beautiful, fiery Sicilian woman DONATA, who is waiting for him to ask her to marry. 

When the CIA decides to close their Sicilian office and insists that CARL return home, he panics. He tells DONATA he must leave, (she has no idea he is a spy and thinks that his “uncle Sam” needs him to return to America). 

NERO, a fisherman, finds out that CARL is leaving, and he is overly distraught; much to CARL’s surprise, NERO reveals that he is a KGB agent who has been in Sicily monitoring CARL’s actions. If CARL has to return home, NERO will have to go back to the Ukraine… 

The two aging spies decide to team up to deceive their respective governments, first by pretending that there are WMD’s in the small fishing town; a ploy that nearly gets them killed when the US torpedo their makeshift “chemical weapons” site. 

Their next plan, to convince their superiors that they are trying to “turn” their counterpart spies, result in the CIA and KGB hiring hit men to head to Sicily and kill their rogue spies.  

NERO and CARL team up, with the help of DONATA, a blimp pilot, as well as DON LUPANO the mob boss and manage to evade the dangerous hit men and live happily ever after.  CARL and DONATA get married.

Young Orphan NICHOLAS NORTH gets adopted by a roving gang of thieves, and befriends a nervous hedgehog HESHY.  When the gang gets caught and arrested, Nicholas and Heshy are left to free them, but they quickly run afoul of a gang of vicious Vikings, who throw them in a dungeon.  In the dungeon, they meet a turtle, CAPTAIN SIBELIUS who gives them a tip about a home to rob.  During the robbery, NICHOLAS and HESHY are caught by beautiful SARAH who screams in terror when she hears Heshy the hedgehog start talking. 
 
NICHOLAS and HESHY are punished by the government, but SARAH frees them and asks for their help; her entire village has been stolen by a wicked witch.  Sarah insists that Nicholas and Heshy must help her by going to see some Elves, and tracking down a Shaman.  Nicholas is skeptical.
 
Nicholas is shocked to find the village of elves that make “toys” and work with the powerful SHAMAN.  NICHOLAS meets SHAMAN and the SHAMAN surprises Nicholas by telling Nicholas that he is possibly the heir of immortality, a powerful descendant of the north winds who has the power to beat the Hellion and free the villagers.   SHAMAN, NICHOLAS, SARAH, HESHY and a helper KRIEL (who designs a flying vehicle similar to Santa’s Sleigh) head through dangerous lands, including a land of the undead, on their quest to find HELLION.
 
The SHAMAN disappears (attempting to commune with the dead to verify if Nicholas is indeed the chosen one) and NICHOLAS searches for a Viking, AGIR, to help. The Viking tells NICHOLAS how to track the Shaman down in the land of the dead.  NICHOLAS finds the Shaman, but the Viking fails to protect Sarah, and she too is kidnapped by the Hellion’s minions.
 
NICHOLAS heads to find the HELLION.  She wants to steal his power of immortality.   In a fierce battle, NICHOLAS manages to free the captives and defeat the Hellion.  NICHOLAS and SARAH grow up to be Mr. And Mrs. Claus, “but that’s a story for another night.”

COMMENTS 
Very charming script, good characters, interspersed with levity as well as pathos. There are a few really funny sequences – notably a scene on the street where the uptight father VICENZO mistakenly overhears a phone conversation between two gay lovers (it was really a man talking to his young son), as well the sequence where the gay friends from ROME pretend to be straight.  The relationship between the two gay sons and their father, as well as the grandmother’s touching, romantic story, ground the film in real emotion. Strong storytelling – it is said to be releasing soon, so perhaps still best to watch something, but recommended read. 

SUMMARY 
INTRO – Fifty years ago:  We see a man and a girl struggle with a gun in a farmhouse and hear a shot go off. 

TODAY:  TOMASSO is a young man in the CANTONE family; they argue a lot, and own a pasta company. 

TOMASSO tells his brother, ANTONIO, with whom he is supposed to run the pasta factory; that he is leaving for ROME, that he secretly got a degree in the arts, that he wrote a book and wants to be a writer, and finally, that he’s gay. “And always have been.” Tomasso wants to shock his parents and get thrown out, so that he can be “free.” 

At another family gathering TOMASSO prepares to tell his father VICENZO the news; expecting that his father will throw him out of the family.  As he’s clinking his glass, his brother ANTONIO chimes in and starts telling a “story” about a young boy who felt sexually attracted to other boys but never had the nerve to tell his parents; TOMASSO assumes ANTONIO is talking about TOMASSO; but is shocked, along with the rest of the family, when ANTONIO admits to being gay. VICENZO throws him out and has a small heart attack. 

In the hospital, VICENZO tells TOMASSO that he’s all he has left. 

TOMASSO is forced to stick around and help ALBA run the business, despite the fact that he has no knowledge of business.   He reluctantly learns about the business and is very impressed by ALBA; a strong, smart woman, who lets herself get attracted to TOMASSO and is embarrassed when he rejects her.  TOMASSO also lets his sister ELENA participates in the business, as its clear she knows far more than he. 

ANTONIO returns and admits to TOMASSO that he’s been living with his lover MICHELE.  Antonio and Tomasso fight. 

TOMASSO admits to his sister ELENA that he is gay; she seems un phased.  “What are you thinking about?” “I am wondering if I am gay too!” 

The townsfolk gossip endlessly about the news that ANTONIO is gay;  STEFANIA stands up for her son and outrages a neighbor, calling the woman’s son’s fiancée a slut. 

TOMASSO’s lover MARCO and several of their gay friends from ROME surprise TOMASSO and arrive in the village; TOMASSO is terrified, but the friends put on a show of pretending to be straight. “Oh, girls? Excellent….” “I work in a market, unloading crates,” etc. 

DAVIDE, one of the more flamboyant; gives TOMASSO’s drunken AUNT LUCIANE a pill that makes her stay up all night reorganizing the attic.

TOMASSO makes a grand announcement, but rather than admit he is gay, he tells his father that he has no love for pasta and wants to return to Rome to work as a writer.  

TOMASSO’s grandmother dies.  The family, including ANTONIO and his lover MICHELE arrive and hold a funeral. 

In her final will, GRANNY admits a love affair with her husband’s uncle, a man who could “not love her that way in return” (presumably because he was gay as well).  He is the man from the intro, and GRANNY was the girl; she was so distraught about marrying someone else she nearly killed herself.  In her will, she gives some of her land, uncle NICOLAS’s house; to ANTONIO and MICHELE. The gesture seems to bring the family back together. 

TOMASSO boards a train to return to Rome, kissing ALBA farewell.

EDITH (Meg Ryan) is taking her daughter, AUDREY, on an autumn tour of New England colleges; GEORGE (Greg Kinnear) is doing the same with his son, CONRAD.  When their paths cross at the university, George and Edith wind up spending the day together and recapturing their youth. 

COMMENTS:
Mediocre Romantic Comedy that leans heavily on its influences; referencing JULES & JIM over and over in an attempt to capture some of the freewheeling spirit of the French New Wave and transport it to the traditionally staid New England countryside; the effect feels canned and artificial.  TV/ VIDEO value with small prices, maybe, if Meg Ryan still has any value.  Greg Kinnear is fun and charming, but Meg is looking a bit worse for the wear these days.  First time director.

SUMMARY:
GEORGE & his too cool for school seventeen year old son CONRAD go on a tour of MIDDLETON college.  EDITH and her uptight daughter AUDREY are on the tour as well.   GEORGE and EDITH immediately butt heads and argue with each other throughout the day.  

After both parents wind up arguing with their children, they bump into each other in the library and decide to make their tour a bit more spontaneous. They run off, leaving their kids to take the tour on their own.  EDITH steals a pair of bikes and the two ride happily through campus. 

EDITH takes him to the top of a campus belltower, where GEORGE reveals he has a fear of heights.  GEORGE buys her a vanilla ice cream cone.  They audit a theater class where they are pushed into an improv scene that quickly becomes highly emotional.  They have lunch together and George asks her what they are doing.  “You call it just having lunch? Because the words swimming around in my head are scaring me to death,” he admits.  Edith is reluctant to talk about her feelings.  She storms away, “If you need me, I’ll be in the real world.”  

EDITH has a change of heart and chases GEORGE down, pulling him into a projection booth where they nearly kiss, until they are interrupted by the projectionist. 

Meanwhile, CONRAD and AUDREY get into a fight; he calls her uptight and she accuses him of trying to hard to be cool.  CONRAD accidentally gets mistaken for a campus DJ and gets dragged into the DJ seat; “welcome to radio kid.” 

AUDREY has a meeting with linguistics professor EMERSON and nearly has a nervous breakdown when she finds out that he is retiring.  “You can’t do this to me!” She had planned to come to school solely for the purpose of studying with him. 

GEORGE and EDITH wind up smoking put with a couple of students; both of them get overly emotional and the student/potheads try to cheer them up.  

Bells start chiming all over campus; its time for the VICTORY FLOAT’; all the kids in school jump in the lake.  GEORGE and EDITH kiss in the lake, but run away when they see the campus cops approaching.  They both realize their brief romance is ending. EDITH cries. 

They return to the parking lot where they find their kids.  CONRAD had a wonderful day, “you were right dad, Middleton is not that bad.”  AUDREY will never come here. “You couldn’t pay me.” Both parents are so upset that they need their kids to drive them home.

DIRECTOR: Marcel Langenegger
WRITER: Noah Lukeman and Jordan Roberts

STATUS: In Development
GENRE: Action/War Drama
READER: Joe Rusin / Comments by Steven Murphy

LOGLINE: The true story of a tough captain in World War II who leads an impossible mission behind enemy lines in a secret mission to save General Patton’s son-in-law.

COMMENTS:
A traditional war movie, BROTHERS IN ARMS mixes the gung-ho characters from movies like THE DIRTY DOZEN with a plot similar to SAVING PRIVATE RYAN (saving one man) but with the benefit of being based on a true story.  This pretty well sums up the film—there is little new here, just variants on what we’ve seen in the past.  This time the tough guy is Jewish, which creates an interesting dynamic of suspense (he’s in greater risk if captured).  There is potentially a decent movie here—the script promises some great battle scenes, and the true story and its historical import are intriguing.  The movie misses a lot of opportunities of developing the characters, though, and often what makes war movies stand out are the soldier characters.  The men in this film aren’t given much development other than Baum, and the script feels thinner for it. there is potentially a decent war movie here that could benefit greatly from a good cast and smart directing.  Consider.

STEVE COMMENTS -  Script is a throwback,  feels a bit like an Audey Murphy movie, filled with good old American bravado.  There’s no modern twist on this, the Jewish angle is handled subtly, simply adding depth to the main character without becoming the real driving point of the movie.  The action sequences read well and I was rooting for the Americans throughout, and it was somewhat refreshing that this isn’t about Iraq.  Director hasn’t had a film released yet, his first film is upcoming, the thriller DECEPTION that used to be called THE TOURIST, it would be great to see that before deciding… Also, no cast yet attached.  B popcorn.  It’d be best to wait at least until cast, but my reaction is generally positive. 

SUMMARY:
It is winter early in the year 1945, and American prisoners of war, and their ranking officer COLONEL JOHN WATERS, are being marched west from camps near the eastern front.  Those prisoners too weak to make the walk are shot.  They are being marched to Hammelburg, a P.O.W. camp 60 miles from the Allied lines on the Western Front.  There Waters meets German GENERAL VON GOECKEL, the commander of the camp, who seeks to be fair, but is a stern man, having Waters beaten when he is insubordinate.

Elsewhere, we meet CAPTAIN ABRAHAM BAUM, a gung ho veteran fighter, as he saves one of his men from a mine only to be wounded himself.  In the hospital, Baum remembers growing up in the Bronx seeing his brother beaten up for being Jewish, and knowing he must be tough to never let it happen to him.  Baum quickly recovers from his wounds, romances a nurse, and draws the attention of GENERAL PATTON, who visits him with friend and advisor MAJOR STILLER to task Baum with leading a force to rescue the “200 P.O.W.s” in Hammelburg, behind enemy lines.  Baum takes the mission, even though it seems impossible—he has only 250 men, and he must leave the same night and return within 24 hours.  Away from Baum, Stiller is against Patton’s secret mission, since he knows it is only to rescue Waters, who is revealed to be Patton’s son-in-law.  When he can’t persuade Patton, Stiller insists that he go with Baum’s task force.  We meet Baum’s tough unit, many of whom are Jewish (even knowing that Jews are executed on site by Nazis rather than taken prisoner).  Some of his ragtag team are the drunken NUTTO, a tank operator, the hillbilly SGT GRAHAM, and LT. LANGE and PVT WISE, both rookies.  

The team sets out with a vicious battle in a village to punch a whole in the German lines.  Past the lines, Baum’s unit trucks along, trying to appear as a German unit, which allows them to take a German unit doing exercises by surprise and wipe them out.

Word reaches the German command about Baum’s band, and they take it for Patton’s big push, shifting huge divisions of reinforcements towards Hammelburg. Patton sees the movement of the German army and realizes they take Baum’s task force for the whole 3rd army.  This is his chance to flank them.

While taking a bridge, Baum’s unit takes heavy fire, but since they are on a secret mission they can’t call air support.  Baum is wounded by shrapnel but fights on, while the bridge is destroyed, stranding some of his unit on the other side.  He watches helpless as his men surrender and the Germans execute Lange.

When Baum reaches the prison camp and fights through the defenses, Von Goeckel surrenders to Waters to get him to establish peace, but a German soldier shoots Waters when he is walking out to meet Baum’s unit.  Baum’s tanks smash into the camp, liberating over a thousand emaciated P.O.W.s.  Stiller finds Waters being operated on in the infirmary.  The surgeon, BERNDT, says Water’s chances are not good, but for any chance at all they can’t move him.  The mission is a fiasco.  Baum almost loses it when he finds out the mission was to rescue Patton’s son-in-law, but Stiller snaps him out of it.  They can’t take all the prisoners, and only the sickest can ride, but Baum draws them all together to make a try for escape.  Meanwhile, the German army of over 10,000 strong is closing in on them.  

During their flight, Baum’s unit is overtaken by the Germans and captured.  They execute the Jewish soldiers on sight, so Stiller throws away the dog tags that identify Baum as Jewish.  Baum is badly wounded with a shot in the leg.  When the Germans ask for the commanding officer, Stiller identifies himself to protect Baum and is taken away.  The Germans move on, leaving the badly wounded Baum to die.

Baum wakes up back in Hammelburg, under the care of Berndt.  The Germans have evacuated, taking most of the POWs but leaving the sickest, including Baum and Waters. They meet and when Baum tells Waters he was leading the mission, Waters is repulsed by the idea that the mission was for him—though Baum won’t admit this.  Baum doses off, is vaguely aware of a plane arriving and loading Waters in.  He awakes again back with the American Army.  Baum chastises Patton for the meaningless mission, but Patton reveals that Baum’s force created a diversion that allowed him to flank the Germans and save thousands of lives.  Titles tell us the Germans surrendered a few weeks later, and the fates of Baum and the surviving members of his heroic task force.

As the only one who knows the industrial secret left behind by her father, the enigmatic young girl will become the victim of a sinister plan to get the information out of her by taking advantage of her sensory confusion. As the plot unfolds, the two men closest to her will become crucial to its outcome: Carles, Joana’s fiancé and her father’s right-hand man, and Vicent, a young, impulsive servant working at the Prats mansion.

COMMENTS
The frustrating thing about this project is that there was clearly a lot of thought, and even craft involved, but throughout the script I kept finding myself wishing that it was more compelling, wishing that it read more fluidly, and that the story was more exciting. There is literally only two sequences where I was thoroughly engaged: the scene where Vicent pretends to be Carles, and Joanna falls in love with him; and the opening sequence where Prat shows off his invention andhis daughter falls into her sickness.  Everything else that surrounded those two vibrant scenes was shockingly flat, and as dull as Carles.   With great direction, there could be some merit, but as a prebuy I don’t recommend.


SUMMARY
Joana, 12, is sick, but steels herself; ready to participate in her father’s crucial presentation about his new invention, a telescopic rifle. Her father PRAT, shows the rifle to German army officers and the presentation is until everything falls apart when an officer drops the prototype, destroying it, at the very same moment Joana is overcome by a dizzy spell and faints. When she wakes, she is incapable of recognizing anyone around her. She screams.

Seven years later, in Barcelona, a 26 year old man, VINCENT, is beaten up and kidnapped by thugs. “not his face!”

Eleven days earlier, Vicent gets a job working at the Prat mansion and is shocked to find that the place is kept like a strange asylum; Joana is practically quarantined; no mirrors are allowed, and guests must wear ribbons to identify themselves.

Prats’ factory, “Joana Lenses” is invaded by an intruder whom Prats believes was hired by his old lover and business partner, the dutch woman PREVERT; whom he accuses of trying to steal the designs for the telescopic rifle lense. He insists the plans no longer exist.

CARLES, Joana’s fiancée and Prats’ trusted employee, asks Prats to consider remaking the lens, insisting that it would get them out of the companies financial dire straights.

Vicent begins falling for Joana; He gets into a fistfight with another servant who was mocking her. MARGA, Vicent’s boss, is outraged and he gets fired.

Intruders break into the factory; Prat is alone, and tries to defend himself but gets brutally murdered. Joana is devastated. “Why cant I hear him breathing!?!”

CUT BACK TO Vicent in captivity: he has been hired by Prevet to infiltrate the estate and find secrets about the lens.   Vicent reluctantly agrees. He’s got an accompliss, the DR. MEISSNER is also working for Prevet; and he arranges to have Joana isolated for three days as a radical “cure” for her sickness.

They smuggle Joana out into a replica of the COCOON; and get Vicent to pretend to be Carles, in order to get the info about the invention out of her.  Vicent goes in to speak to her, but she freaks out, thinking that he’s trying to sabotage the treatment.

Prevert and Meissner watch as Vicent seduces Joana; “he’s gotten further in a couple of hours than Carles has in years.” Joana is indeed moved by his flirtations, and romantic gestures; her real fiancée has long been cold and distant.

A great storm rumbles in; and inside the fake cocoon, Joana starts to panic.  Prevert is getting tired of Vicent’s slow con; they’ve only got twelve hours left and they need an answer.

Vicent’s seduction works so well she winds up completely falling for him, sleeping with him, and having her first orgasm ever. She also tells him a series of numbers that likely are the key to the telescopic lens design.  “I TRUST you.”

Vicent fears for her safety and turns on the Prevert gang; running to the cops, barely eluding the gunfire or Prevert’s thugs.  The cops call the Prat house, and CARLES runs to the cocoon room… but somehow, Joana has been transported back, none the wiser that she’d been kidnapped. Carles is very confused by his fiancee’s mysterious, flirtatious behaviour.  She tries to seduce him; “you feel like a different person….” And they both realize, with horror, what has happened.

Vicent gets held in prison for lying about the kidnap (the Prevert’s manage to remove the cocoon quickly enough that his entire story seems like a lie). CARLES confronts him, kicking him and lashing out, enraged.  Carles tells Joana what she’s done.

To cover up the con; Prevert’s goons kill all the stagehands who helped pull off the ruse.  MEISSNER kills himself out of grief.

As Prevert goes into production on the telescopic lenses, the thugs try to kill Vincent; Vicent finds Joana and they embrace, but the thug opens fire. A riot breaks out and cops kill the thugs. Joana falls violently to the ground, banging her head; and when she awakes, seemingly briefly regains her capacity for recognition. She sees Vicent, her true love. Then she dies.

A quiet doorman spends his nights drugging and raping one of the tenants in the building.


COMMENTS
Script is pretty great; a chilling, almost terrifying thriller that reminds me of a Spanish Psycho, with a psychotic lead character cruelly driven to “wipe the smile” off the face of a lovely, friendly tenant. The story unfolds in a way that you don’t realize Cesar is a nut until about 40 pages in; and the initial twist gives way to grim horror as you watch him proceed to devastate this woman, day in and day out. The sequence where Cesar passes out in the bathroom while they are in the other room having sex is pretty amazing; I think I found myself literally holding my breath.  This could be a crossover type film as well; I recommend across the board.


SUMMARY
CESAR wakes up in bed with CLARA. He climbs to the roof of the building and briefly contemplates suicide before returning to his basement apartment.

Cesar is the doorman of the building; a young daughter of a tenant, URSULA sees him in the morning and asks if he ‘got it,’ and he hands her a wad of bills that he “found in the elevator.”  Cesar keeps a meticulous chart of the movements of the tenants; ie, Clara left at 8:25am…

Cesar visits his mother who’s bedridden and unresponsive. He tells her that he might have a shot with the woman in 3B and that things may not be working out with Clara.  When he gets back, a tenant in 4B accuses him of being late and warns him to watch out. “I don’t care about your personal issues.”

After his shift is over, Cesar does a few errands in various apartments; making his final stop in Clara’s.  It seems as if they are having an affair, but when she comes home he hides under her bed. He waits for her to fall asleep, then sneaks out and drugs her… knocking her completely unconscious. He roots through her stuff, disrobes, gets into pajamas, and lies in bed next to her. In the morning he makes sure to leave before she wakes, but on his way out he gets caught by URSULA… she knows what he’s been doing and she blackmails him. She demands he give her “an adult movie.”

Cesar doesn’t like the new cleaning person; the son of the main cleaning lady; so he lies and tries to get the guy in trouble, fabricating a  story that the tenants in one of the offices complained about the job he’s doing.

Cesar sneaks into Clara’s again; but the drugs have a strange reaction this time; Clara wakes up and sees him briefly.  She tells him the next day that she had a dream about him.

Cesar starts amplifying his routine; upping the dosage on his chloroform to drug her, planting rotten fruit around her house that makes her break out in an awful rash, sending her more and more anonymous texts and creepy, romantic letters, and spending every night sleeping naked next to her. “I think she’s starting to crumble,” he tells his mother happily.

She wakes up one morning and her apartment is completely swarming with fruit flies; Cesar promises he’ll fumigate. He asks her about her stalker, and she’s surprised “how do you know about that?” She tells him that the police are tracking the texts and closing in on him.

Cesar thinks about killing himself again, but vows to stay alive to “wipe that smile off that shitty bitch’s face… I’m not leaving this world without dragging her with me.”

Cesar brings a girl (a whore, presumably) back to her vacant apartment after he’s fumigated, and has sex with her on Clara’s bed.  

Cesar frames the cleaner’s son; setting it up so the cops believe he is the one sending Clara the messages.

Cesar plans to tie Clara up to her bed; but when she returns her boyfriend MARCOS is with her… Cesar hides under the bed, petrified, but winds up accidentally drugging himself with chloroform… he tries to get out of the apartment but winds up passing out in the tub.  In the morning, he tries to escape but Marcos catches him; Cesar lies and says he was sneaking in to retrieve tools. Clara believes him. Marcos is still suspicious.

 The tenant from 4B and the BUILDING MANAGER show up and tell Cesar he is fired (for tardiness and killing plants; they still don’t realize he’s a psycho).

 Clara finds out she’s pregnant. Marcos is livid and accuses her of cheating; its mathematically impossible for him to be the father.  Cesar is the father. That night, Cesar drugs both of them and rapes Clara (again).

 Marcos tells Cesar there’s a problem in the apartment; but once Cesar gets inside, he reveals that he’s found the drugging paraphernalia. Cesar admits everything, and kills Marcos; faking it to look like a suicide.

 Cesar sneaks into Ursula’s room; she saw him sneak out after killing Marcos. He threatens her and tells her never to tell… nearly pushing her out a window, but ultimately letting her live.

 Nine months later, he writes a letter to Clara; telling her all the details of the drugging, the rapes, the murder… and telling her that it is his son.  Cesar kills himself. ",,

A troubled teen jumps out a window to her doom; and finds herself in a mysterious underworld where she must battle to return to life. 

COMMENTS 
Interesting for Indie Circle as an extremely arthouse/ niche picture only… it’s a mixed media piece with a narrative that veers into extremely experimental territory while maintaining an emotional grounding… it is a hallucinatory journey through the psyche of a suicidal teen, in the moments before she jumps out her window to certain death… the writing definitely bites off some heady material, and spouts poetry worthy of the troubled teens its focusing on (which is not always a good thing); and though the florid wordiness got a bit out of hand, on a whole, it’s unique and satisfying.   Worth reading and one of a kind; not a traditional pre-buy; and definitely NOT for broader audiences. It’s got manga/ animation elements and a very visual writing style that will need to be quite impressive for this to work.  

SUMMARY 
A young Japanese boy drowns himself while his parents look on in horror.  He wakes and sees his own dead body. Four mysterious figures approach him. 

CUT TO: SARA is a troubled 15 year old girl; she’s disinterested by her schoolwork and alienated from her parents. She is fascinated by photography and by the street poetry of a mysterious man named LIRIKO. 

Sara gets in trouble on a school trip for wandering off to look at his poems; and one night she sneaks into an abandoned home and seemingly finds his lair; a list of names, including hers, is written on the wall. She leaves a book of photos for him, as well as her mobile number. 

The next day she gets thrown out of school for coming late; when she gets home her mother is irate; upset she stayed out all night.  Even her best friend LUIS seems tired of her. She texts him that she found Liriko, and he tells her to “forget that rubbish and get real.” 

She packs up a bag full of supplies and returns to the Liriko house but its completely gone… destroyed by a development company that works with her father.

Devastated, Sara returns home and jumps out her window. Her mother seems to sense that something is wrong. Dario, the boy Sara has a crush on, calls and leaves a message; worried about her. 

Sara lies on the ground, broken and battered.  A weird dream/ hallucination begins, a door to a mysterious underworld opens. Sara sees herself, looking frightened and hurt; Sara sees five dark figures; Medusa, Prosak, Totem, Foco and Liriko. They lead her into a maze-like underground tunnel; Foco disappears into a vast darkness… they are being pursued by a mysterious dark entity.  Sara begs for an explanation.  “you will find the answers if three tests you pass!” 

She sees another group of five figures, leading a young troubled looking boy who has slit his wrists. The leader of that group bids Sara “good luck.” Sara is starting to realize her situation. 

Sara is led towards a building with a column made entirely of mirrors; each showing someone troubled, including the Japanese boy from the opening of the film.  The figures prepare her for her first test; she must return to her home, to see “what still remains to be resolved.”  The figures track her as she returns to the lifeless, colorless world she’d left behind. 

She finds herself in a nightmarish version of her home; her mother is lying in bed, trembling in fear; a crazy umbilical like cord grows between them; Sara is forced to cut through it; she runs to her father, but he seems trapped to a wall… she is plagued by visions of a girl in WHITE begging her to join her in eternal peace; SARA cries out and pulls away, desperate to stay alive. 

She wakes in the underworld where Liriko assures her that she is still alive; they are her protectors and stopped her from killing herself just moments before she jumped out the window. He tells her that she has passed the first test.   The girl in white appears in the tunnels and starts chasing them.   Meanwhile, in the real world, Sara is inching closer to the window, and to her death.  

Prosak disappears, swallowed by the darkness. The remaining guides, Liriko, Totem and Medussa are despondent, and giving up hope in Sara, but she comes to a realization, that there’s a “hidden” path. She hops INTO a graffiti image on the sides of the tunnel.  Liriko starts firing inspired words, manifesting them, as if “he was building a babelic path of words” as he recites them. “the great path of words, this is it. This is where your esteem, your wager, your spirit manifests inteself. If you think about it too much you lose.” 

The tunnel leads them to a huge underground coliseum type place with a small exit; guarded by a hooded figure.  It’s the second test.   Totem is irate;  “its her fault we lost Prosak! We all know she wont pass the test!” She waits while the teenage boy takes the test before her; he doesn’t pass… and dies.  

Sara goes into an empty room; filled only with white lines, seemingly made up of energy. She finds SARA 2 – a negative reincarnation of herself, shrouded in pain, who wants to die. Sara fights back and eventually wins, screaming I AM VERBO, and creating graffiti that says VERBO, seemingly with her mind.  LIRIKO admits they are all part of her; “I am you” and fades away after telling her she will still face a third test. 

She finds herself back in her room; she’s not committed suicide. DARIO calls; she thanks him for worrying and tells him she’ll see him at school. The next day she rises to see her father in the early morning, giving him his files for work that wind up insulting her father’s client, the development company… but he gets a big laugh, liberated; Sara wakes her mother and tells her mother that she knows its hurting her but she needs to “try to be herself,” and tells her she loves her. Her mother is moved. At school, she wows the class with a stirring reading of Don Quixote, and runs off with Dario… two young lovers and kindred spirits. 

Her manifestation, VERBO, appears as a figure, guiding the troubled Japanese boy in his moment of darkness.

COMMENTS 
I liked this story very much; it’s rich, dense, exciting; it creates a whole sci fi world and creates an action plot within it; that being said, it’s so packed with info and crammed with ideas that I think it will actually wind up alienating a core action audience, while not really attracting a core arthouse audience… the closest example I can think of is that this is much closer to CHILDREN OF MEN than ROBOCOP or the TERMINATOR… it plays with the sci-fi action genre, but for mainstream audiences, I think its too clever by half. It’s so mindbending and so wrapped in on itself with the multiple time travel elements, B stories and mysterious interweaving storylines, that it runs a serious risk of being muddled and confusing.  Need cast info before final analysis, but I think it’s probably not mainstream enough for Lat Am; and I assume price is likely high. 
 
 
SUMMARY 
JOE. JOE is a killer hired by clients in the future… 25 years from now, time travel has been invented, but made illegal. It is only used by criminal enterprises for the purposes of murder; it’s impossible to hide a body in the future, so the gangs must send victims back in time, to be killed by hit men from the past. 
 
Another looper. ZED, is forced to “close his loop;” ie, he gets hired to kill HIMSELF; his 25 years older version gets sent back, and for a large amount of money, Zed kills his older version. “Have fun for the next thirty years.” 
 
Joe’s friend, the novice Looper SETH breaks the rules by chickening out and “letting a loop run.” “this is not a good thing.”  He turns to Joe for help.  Joe reluctantly hides Seth in his safe in the floorboards. KID BLUE, a GAT MAN; and no friend of Joe’s bangs on the door; he’s there to take Joe to “Abe’s.” 
 
ABE is a crime boss from the future; he tells JOE he’s got to give up SETH; Joe returns home to find his safe still full of gold bars, but SETH is gone… fresh blood smeared on some of the bricks. 
 
OLD SETH is running through the streets of the city; a SCAR appears, as if being written on his arm… it tells him a time and a destination. One by one, his fingers start to disappear; then his nose… the gangsters are clearly torturing Seth and OLD SETH is getting the wounds… KID BLUE finds OLD SETH at the rendezvous point and kills him. 
 
JOE keeps on with his duties as a looper; killing targets easily… until a different target appears; OLD JOE takes JOE by surprise, beats him up and escapes. KID BLUE comes to JOE’s place to kill him, but JOE locks KID BLUE in a safe; another GAT MAN shoots JOE and Joe winds up falling out a window and losing consciousness. 
 
OLD JOE. 
 
The scene from the field unplays as before except this time JOE easily kills OLD JOE.  We see a quick progression of JOE’s life; as he takes his payout money, goes to France, becomes a gangster, falls in love, settles down and has a nice life with his wife… but GANGSTERS burst in and attack; new OLD JOE gets the best of them, but not before they hurt his wife… he heads back in time, beats up JOE and escapes. 
 
KID BLUE and the GAT MEN are on both New and Old Joe’s trail… JOE carves a rendezvous point into OLD JOE’S arm… they meet at a diner. OLD JOE tries to talk some sense into his “stupid” younger self. He tells her about their wife and that the RAINMAKER does horrible things to her.  OLD JOE tells JOE he has come back to find the rainmaker before he takes over; and “stop him from killing my wife.” 
 
The GAT MEN and KID BLUE burst into the diner; JOE turns on OLD JOE; “I’ve got him!” but OLD JOE kills Gat Men and escapes; JOE realizes KID BLUE has turned on him and flees as well.  JOE and OLD JOE separately disappear into a corn field. 
 
SARA.  (Old Joe’s wife?) Joe appears in her corn field; she hears him and threatens him, but doesn’t see him.  
 
Kid Blue meets with ABE; ABE is livid. He smashes one of Kid Blue’s hands and blames him for letting Old Joe get away. 
 
JOE stumbles into SARA’s yard; she and her 6 year old son CID, help him. She can tell he’s a junky and will die if he doesn’t get help.  He scares her when he reveals that he’s there because a LOOPER from the future has come back to find THE RAINMAKER and kill him; and thinks that the RAINMAKER lives at this farm…  
 
JOE agrees to stay at the farm to protect CID; whom he believes OLD JOE will try to kill.  CID, despite being warned by SARA to stay away from JOE, sneaks in and helps him set up a communication device and tells him that Sara isn’t his real mother; “she’s a liar.” 
 
A GAT MAN shows up at Sara’s door and demands she lead him through the house. JOE and CID hide quietly. 
 
OLD JOE’s memories of his wife start to fade… indicating that it is becoming less and less likely that he will meet her. 
 
After the GAT MAN leaves, JOE and SARA wind up sleeping with each other. She opens up, telling him about how she abandoned CID for two years, and that her sister (whom CID thinks is his mother) was killed.  
 
JESSE comes back; holding SARA at gunpoint.  JOE tells him that he’s waiting for his loop; that OLD JOE is coming and that he’s planning to turn OLD JOE in to ABE; JESSE tells him that ABE isn’t gonna reconcile. He’s hired GAT MEN to kill Joe; no matter what happens to OLD JOE.  CID comes in and breaks up the situation, he’s TK (telekinetic) and EXPLODES Jesse… OLD JOE can see JOE’s memories and sees that CID is the rainmaker… but just as he has the realization; OLD JOE gets caught by KID BLUE. 
 
KID BLUE tries to bring OLD JOE in to ABE; but OLD JOE opens fire and kills ALL of the gang; all the gat men, the guards and ABE; with a bullet to the head. Only Kid blue survies. 
 
JOE and OLD JOE have a showdown at the farm; OLD JOE thinks the only way to save his wife is to kill CID; but JOE comes up with another plan; he shoots HIMSELF in the face. CID and SARA survive… the clouds clear… presumably, CID doesn’t turn towards a life of crime, because JOE changed the course of his life… but that’s just a guess, because the film ends before we find out.

 ",,,,,,,,"LOGLINE
The Bass and Schiff- families are best friends and neighbors, living directly across the street from each other on Orange Drive. When the Bass's 24-year old daughter Nina returns home for the first time in years, Nina and David Schiff (Laurie) and themselves surprised by a new, inexplicable attraction to one another.

COMMENTS
This is a well paced, well written script about two suburban couples whose lives are thrown into chaos over one holiday season. It reads like an indie comedy but feels like it wants to be something more - and, with Julian Farino directing it may end up more mainstream. The first act is very polished and fun, and while not as laugh out loud
funny as maybe it could be, it does have some memorable moments. I got a bit bogged down in the middle as I started to question whether the concept was executed as precisely as it has to be. The characters are well developed and for the most part believable, I just worry that in the end there is not enough heart to make this audiences fall in love with the characters a la LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE. 

The story really centers on a relationship between a man and a much younger woman, and it is important that the audience buys into the sincerity of this relationship - I am not entirely convinced. We never see any real love scenes between them which bothered me a bit - can't fully get the sense of the heat of the relationship which is ripping two families apart. I feel like Hugh Laurie is not soft enough to play someone who you root for when he is self-destructive and ruins the lives of those around him. Maybe I'm wrong about this but I just feel like it will not have the heart that it needs to if it really wants to transcend the indie sphere. I think that casting and execution are essential to making this work.

Catherine Keener's character is very strange and I don't think we ever really understand what it is that she is feeling. This is problematic as the story requires us to believe that both of the characters redeem themselves in the end and are better for their experience. I think that with Keeners character we just see her lose it, so to speak, but we never really see her get it back. 

There is a lot of craziness and inappropriate moments that lend themselves well to this kind of humor, but I wonder whether the movie as a whole will work. This may be good for the UK if it plays bigger than the script. Worth tracking/reading but not a sure bet. Reads like something in between AMERICAN BEAUTY and ELECTION, but probably not as fleshed out as either of those. Budget is just under $10M according to the sales agent and I find for this cast that is outrageously high for Hugh Laurie and Catherine Keener. It will likely play to the 35+ audience and I see how they are trying to bill this as a PG-13 holiday film but I really feel that it needs a bigger cast to break out.

MW COMMENTS
I don't see this as a pre-buy. This is by no means American Beauty. It is a very 'middle America' coming of age type of story that will Premiere in Sundance, but with little foreign box office potential.

SUMMARY
The Bass and the Schiff families are best friends and live across the street from each other on Orange Drive. Nina, the Bass’s somewhat estranged daughter who is built up to be a bit of a disaster, comes back home after 5 years of traveling and partying and  is getting on swimmingly with the Schiff’s son, Toby, to everyone's delight.  Then she David Schiff have this moment where they accidentally kiss, then another moment where it is intentional, and then they are having a full-blown affair and in love.

It is set in 1849 and a serial killer is terrorizing the streets of Baltimore. It soon becomes clear that the killer's methods are taken straight from the pages of the gruesome short stories of Edgar Allan Poe (Colin Farrell). 

Edgar starts helping out the police and joins forces with detective Fields (Jeremy Renner). They work around the clock to stop the killer by predicting his next move.

COMMENTS:
The script reminded me of Goya's Ghost. The flop Hanway sold a few years ago. It is very dry and literary. The script is dense and explanatory. This is one of those films that you hear about, and it will never be your first pick to go see. I feel it would be an uphill battle to get the audience to go. Ingredients: Literature, poetry, period piece, dark without humor and a sad ending. The perfect recipe for a big risk. Film Nation compares it to Sherlock Holmes, but that film had some lightness and British wit to it and had a satisfying ending. 

In this film there is nobody to root for. Edgar is the lead, but yet he comes off as a jerk, and you even wonder why this lovely Emily likes him so much. The ending doesn't work at all to me. Why after Edgar saves his fiance, the love of his life, would he disappear. The writers tried to tie Edgar's mystery fiction stories together and make one fictional story, but yet keeping Edgar's real life ending the same, where he dies at 40 alone in a park with no records of cause of death.  I don't see THE RAVEN as a potential hit.

When ruthless energy sales executive Margaret begins receiving letters from Marguerite, her seven year-old self, she is forced to confront the disparity between her childhood dreams and the woman she has become.  She embarks on a mission of self-discovery, shedding her old way of life and, through fits and starts, finds her way to a new one.

COMMENTS:
A quirky mid-life crisis script that is good-spirited, but a bit disconnected and inconsistent.  The story seems pushed, and the plausibility of events is taken for granted.  Although the characters can be appealing at times, their problems are often trite and vague– there only to move the plot along, and some of the side characters are shallow to the point of cliché.  Pass.

SUMMARY:
High powered energy executive MARGARET uses famous historical women (Marie Curie, Maria Callas, etc.) as her literal role models, giving her confidence as she successfully moves through negotiations with investors.  Her lover and coworker MALCOM consults with her and wishes her “Happy Birthday.”  MARGARET is then visited by MR. MERIGNAC, a retired solicitor who seems to know her.  He delivers her a package containing four letters from ‘MARGUERITE’– herself at seven years old.  One letter from her younger self question what she is doing with her life and reminds her of her dreams.  The other three are for her to open depending on what she is doing.  She holds on to the one marked “Other.”

MARGARET’s love life and business life suffer as she becomes increasingly preoccupied with the still-arriving letters and flashbacks of her past.  At first she resists, and is angry with MR. MERIGNAC, but after learning the extent of his contract with her younger self, begins to give in to her memories of her family and closest friend, PHILIBERT.  With MR. MERIGNAC’s help she recovers a trove of picture-cards she had hidden with PHILIBERT’s help.  She argues with MALCOM and goes to the Lascaux Caves to meet PHILIBERT.  Unimpressed with PHILIBERT’s adult self, she tells him to move on and tries to find her brother, MATHIEU, who she hasn’t seen since she left for boarding school.  MATHIEU resents her years out of touch and her apparent selfishness, and she leaves unsatisfied.

At work, MARGARET discovers that her boss has earned a promotion MARGARET had been gunning for.  PHILIBERT arrives to return MARGARET her coat and deliver a final letter from MR. MERIGNAC, hospitalized from a heart attack.  The letter from her younger self tells her that all she really wants is to grow up; she has lost ambition and wonder.  MARGARET is shell-shocked, calls out her boss, breaks up with MALCOM, and quits her job, encouraging MALCOM to close the business deal.  She escapes to where her letters refer to buried treasure and digs up a final letter asking her to rediscover her sense of wonder, youth and ambition.  MARGARET makes up with MALCOM and starts an organization to help villages in Africa find clean water.  At the end, she looks down into a hole they have dug, and sees her young nephew, SIMON, smiling on the other side of the world.

She leads a busy life until she becomes a witness to an attempted murder case, and at the same time, things get complicated at work. When things get out of hand she is forced to take a vacation so she heads for ‘Moodo’, a small undeveloped island, where she had once visited to see her grandparents. And where she had befriended a girl named Bok-nam who stills writes to Hae-won asking her to visit despite the fact that Hae-won never bothered to reply.
Upon arriving at the island, Hae-won is shocked to see everyone treating Bok-nam like a slave. As practically the only young woman on the island, she is a plaything for all the men and a free laborer for the women. Sick of all the inhumane treatment, Bok-nam had tried to escape the island several times in the past but had failed each time. She begs Hae-won to help her escape the place, but Hae-won remains indifferent not wanting to be involved in complicated situations. When Bok-nam realizes that her own daughter will follow her footsteps, she tries to escape the island with her daughter. But her daughter gets killed in the process.

GENRE: Animation

LOGLINE

An unlikely hero discovers his band of miniature warriors may be the last hope for humanity in a post apocalyptic world.

COMMENTS

Definitely an interesting project, but I don’t know who the audience would be.   It’s animation, but its themes are dark and twisted, even for a project with Tim Burton’s name on it.  The post apolocalyptic setting and man vs machine conceit are hardly unique, but there is something appealing about the struggle of the underdog rag dolls.

It’s interesting, but I don’t recommend. 

SUMMARY

9 wakes up, disoriented and confused, in an post apocalyptic wasteland.  He is a ragdoll, sewn together from burlap and old machine parts.  He meets 2, a doll who looks much like him, but his materials are even more primitive.   9 tries to speak, but realizes that he cannot. 2 and 9 both have glowing talismans, that seem to be communicating with each other.  

A huge CAT BEAST, a nail and razor studded predatory machine, appears and attacks the rag dolls.  2 protects 9, and sacrifices himself, while 9 manages to hide.  The cat beast gives up looking for 9, and bounds away with 2 in his mouth.  9 chases after them, but falls and passes out.

When he wakes up, he is being repaired by 5, another ragdoll.  5 repairs 9’s voice box, and 9 immediately begins to insist they try to save 2.  9 meets other ragdolls, 1, the grumpy leader of the group, and 8, a huge muscle bound doll who obeys 1.  1 tells 9 that it’s too dangerous to save 2.  He tells 9 about their situation – “when we woke up in this world it was chaos.”   Man had warred with machine, and the entire planet had been nearly decimated.   “The earth split and the skies burned.” According to 1, the ragdolls and the cat beast are the only living beings on the planet, and the dolls live in fear of the beast.  Several of them, (3,4 and 7) have already disappeared.

6, an old, crazy ragdoll, sees 9’s talisman, gets petrified, and says “go back... the source…” 

9 convinces 5 to disobey 1 and go look for 2.  They make their way to an old war machine factory and find 2, but the cat beast hears them and attacks, nearly killing 2.  The three of them fight, and miraculously manage to electrocute the cat beast.  Their elation, however, is short lived.   Moments later, a huge FABRICATION MACHINE rises from the rubble and attcks, killing 2.


5 and 9 run off.  5 leads 9 to the hideout of the twins, 3 and 4, who show 9 a newsreel highliting the fall of civilization.  A scientist had created machine intelligence in the form of the fabrication machine, which has the ability to create other machines.  When governments took his machine to create war machines, the scientist knew that great harm was immenint.  

The fabrication machine builds a WINGED BEAST, which attacks the dolls.  1 is livid, accusing 9 of jeopardizing their safety.   The dolls desperately fight for their lives, but are only saved when 7 appears and manages to help the others kill the beast.  7 is the only female ragdoll, and 5 is in love with her.  Though the beast is dead, their sanctuary is in flames, and they need to find a new place to hide.

1’s leadership is questioned, and after he reveals that he sacrificed 2’s life for the good of the others, there is open rebellion.  While 1’s plan is to find a new hiding spot, 9 believes that they have to find out why the machine is hunting them.  1, 6 and 8 head off on their own and hide in a drain pipe.  9 sees a mysterious, serpentine track heading towards the pipe and rushes to save them.

A huge serpentine SEAMSTRESS machine crawls into the pipe and kills 8, but 9 and the others manage to save 1 and 6.  9 has become the defacto leader of the group, and 1 is not happy. The survivors decide to attack the machine factory and try to roll a barrel of oil towards it (hoping to blow the place up).  Beasts of all kinds start to attack.  The dolls manage to push the barrel into the factory, and the place explodes into flames.  

1 and 9 manage to make peace, and 9 empathises with 1’s choices, realizing that leading a group and ensuring their survival is not easy.  The fabrication machine rises from the rubble of the destroyed factory and attacks, killing 5.  6, in a panic, yells “go to the source.”  

The dolls come to believe that 9’s talisman is leading the beasts towards them.  9 takes 6’s advice and goes to the room where the scientist invented the dolls, realizing that the scientist infused the dolls with his soul, hence, the dolls are all that remains of humanity.  

In the final showdown with the fabrication machine, 1 sacrifices his own life for the good of the others.  9 gets sucked into the machine, and realizes that he’s actually inside the fabrication machine’s mind.  He sees 2,5,6 and 8 who try to entice him to join them.  He realizes that they are just apparitions, created by the machine’s mind.  9 convinces the machine to let him go.  

9 joins together the two haves of the talisman, and the dead dolls’ souls are released.  Rain falls, a flower blooms, there is hope in the wasteland.

LOGLINE

A skilled and charismatic Ping Pong champion whose mental breakdown in the '88 Olympics leads to the murder of his father.  The FBI calls on him to infiltrate the underground layer of a flamboyantly evil villain.  Now he is the only person who can save the world and avenge his father's death.

COMMENTS

A mindless comedy that is trying to capture the absurdist vibe of DODGEBALL, I suppose.  Walken’s role should be fun, but this is one of the silliest things I have ever read.  There are a few laughs, but the plot is all over the place. Pass.

SUMMARY 

RANDY DAYTONA is a ping-pong prodigy who loves rock and roll, his father, and kicking the crap out of his opponents.  When he finds out that his father has risked everything gambling on his final match in the world championships, Randy chokes and loses the match to his young, cocky German rival.  His father, massively in debt to the crime lord FENG, gets killed.

Ten years later, Randy is a shadow of his former self.  He still plays ping-pong, but hasn’t competed since his father’s death.  He now works at a casino doing lame tricks to apathetic crowds.  One day, FBI AGENT MARTINEZ shows up with a strange offer – he tells Randy that he wants him to go undercover, and enter a secret Ping Pong tournament run by Feng.  Martinez wants to use Randy as his ticket into Feng’s lair.  Randy declines, but reconsiders when he thinks about the possibility of putting his father’s killer away.

Randy begins training with an Asian ping pong master, the blind WONG, a Mr. Miyagi like character who trains Randy with help from his daughter MAGGIE a beautiful girl and a master ping pong player whom Randy quickly falls in love with.  After many mysterious lessons (making Chinese food as ping pong training, contemplating the nature of a cricket, playing ping pong with a spoon) Randy begins to compete.  He defeats a local legend, “the dragon” and is offered a “golden paddle” which serves as an invitation to Feng’s tournament. 

At the tournament, Randy realizes that the games are “to the death.”  He tries to run away, but the compound is heavily fortified.   Feng is a madman who likes to put pictures of the dead ping-pong players on the wall and play games where you get electrocuted if you lose a point.  Feng takes an interest in Randy, because Feng also used to be Wong’s prodigy.   He wants Randy to come work for him, to break Wong’s heart.  

Feng sets up a showdown, surprising Randy by making him play to the death against Maggie.   Rather than comply, the two of them fight back, using their paddles as weapons.  

The FBI storms the compound, and Feng sets off a booby trap.  Randy and Feng wind up playing a game of electrocution ping-pong while the compound self-destructs around them.

Randy finds out that Feng has no backhand and easily defeats Feng, who is electrocuted to death.

The script itself seems underdeveloped – at 77 pages it has the feel of an extended treatment, and it would be worth finding out if another draft is coming.  I found myself laughing several times, especially during the sequence when they are making BACK TO THE FUTURE.  Jack Black plays Jerry, and the casting is perfect – Jerry is off beat, eccentric, and manic, all of the characteristics that Black can nail.  On the down side, the Fats Waller stories slowed down the movie and the subplot about Fletcher losing his store seems tacked on – like  a cheesy device in an eighties movie… nevertheless this film has a great director and Black is a perfect fit.  I liked it a lot, but didn’t love it. 


SUMMARY 

MIKE is a 30 year old video store clerk who runs a rundown shop in an industrial area of New Jersey.   His best friend JERRY works nearby at a mechanics, and spends most of his time hanging out at the video shop, wasting Mike’s time, much to the chagrin of MR. FLETCHER, the aging shop owner who lives in an apartment above the store.  

Fletcher likes to reminisce about the old days, often telling tales of  FATS WALLER, a legendary jazz pianist who was actually born in the same building that now houses the video store.  Mike is entranced by the stories, and thinks of Waller as one of his heroes.  

Fletcher goes out of town to celebrate the sixtieth anniversary of Fat’s death, leaving Mike in charge of the store. He warns Mike not to let Jerry hang around the store.  

As soon as Fletcher is gone, Jerry tries to convince Mike to accompany him on a ridiculous mission.  Jerry believes that the power plant across the street is killing him (or at least making him stupid) and he decides to attack it.  Mike, heeding Fletcher’s advice, declines to take part in the mission.  Jerry angrily goes alone and comes back distraught and sick – actually vomiting outside the store.  Jerry and Mike realize that Jerry has gotten “magnetized” by the plant – his entire body is magnetic.  They realize with horror that Jerry’s magnetic field has accidentally erased all the tapes in the store.  

Mike is in a real jam, he fears that the entire business is going to go under unless he can come up with a solution.  When the store’s most loyal customer, MS. KIMBERLY, comes into the shop looking for a copy of BACK TO THE FUTURE, she threatens to rat them out to Fletcher when she finds out that the tape is not there.   Mike and Jerry decide they have to actually do a remake of the classic sci fi.  Mike grabs a camera, Jerry dresses like Christopher Lloyd and the two begin shooting.

Rather than hate the home made movie, MS. KIMBERLY and her young nephew absolutely love it and beg for more.  Mike and Jerry continue making their own movies to replace the blank inventory, shooting RUSH HOUR 2, ROBOCOP and even the LION KING.  They enlist the help of a local girl ALMA who plays Jerry’s love interest in every movie.  Soon the business has caught on, and people are lining up for blocks to get “mike and jerry” movies.

Meanwhile, Fletcher fears that he is going to lose his building.  The city wants to turn the rundown neighborhood into condominiums, and Fletcher needs to raise a lot of dough to save his shop.  He decides to turn the video store into a clone of Blockbuster.  When he returns, he is shocked to see that Mike and Jerry’s business has taken off, but he’s still convinced that a Blockbuster is the only way to save his business.  

The FBI hears about Mike and Jerry’s movies and force them to destroy the tapes.   The guys are devastated, and near giving up, but the community rallies around them, and they band together to do a huge movie that will save the shop.  Mike decides to do a biopic about Fats Waller – even after hearing from Fletcher that the whole Fats Waller tale was just a fib – Fats never lived there.  

The movie comes out great – Alma and Mike fall in love, and Ms. Kimberly and Fletcher fall in love.

Set in modern day barcelona it has at its heart the intimate and transcendent story of Uxbal (bardem), a man unearthing the subtly beautiful from the very corners of human existance.


COMMENTS
A very dark story with an unclear focus, set-up. Again, like his other films, death is everywhere. No light moments at all. Bad news after bad news. The story doesn't really go anywhere, and the characters seem too inconsistent for an audience to start to care about any of them. It is hard to root for anybody. Events don't lead to anything. Many questions arise: what are his motives for doing all this? What is the point? Is it immigration issues in Spain? What did we learn? That it's a nightmare? That there is no hope? Is he being punished for getting paid by mourners who want to communicate with their dead loved-ones? What was the reason he could speak with the dead? 

I am sure the film will be filmed beautifully, and there is a core fan audience. But I don't see this becoming a break out hit. Especially in these tough times. 


SUMMARY

Biutiful- Set in modern day Barcelona. The first scene is between Uxbal (Bardem) and a little 9 year old girl. Father and daughter. There is something odd about the scene in which we can't see their faces and the father seems to drift out of their conversation and into a dream like world. 

In the next scene Uxbal is at the doctor's office. He seems to have a health problem and finds out he has no more than a few months to live.
Uxbal has two children, Ana (9) and Mateo (7). He is divorced from his wife Marambra, who has a bi polar disorder and overal very unstable. It is obvious that her issues is what drove them apart and that they do still love each other. The film has super natural elements. Uxbal seems to be able to communicate with the dead. Mourners go to him to resolve unresolved issues with their loved ones.  

The family seems very troubled. Uxbal lives with the kids. While they are at school, he has odd dealings with illegal immigrants.  He gets fake designer handbags made by the Chinese Hai and supplies them to African illegal street vendors. His contact with the Africans is Ekweme. All the money goes through his hands and he usually gives himself a cut. He also pays off the police to not arrest the African vendors. But African vendors keep going to spots that the police held firm on that were off limits for the vendors. Uxbal seems to be doing these jobs to help the immigrants and make a living at the same time. 

Things start to go downhill. Not only is he dying himself, all he is involved with seems to fall apart. He buys heaters for Hai, who has Chinese immigrants staying at his wear-house. He bought the cheapest kind to pocket some of the money. They next day all the 25 immigrants are dead from carbon-oxide poisoning. The African vendors are arrested by the police as they kept using the off limits area. Ekweme is deported and leaves behind a wife and baby. 

He also finds out that his brother is having an affair with Marambra, his ex wife. This is even more painful, as he was trying to give her another chance with him and with the kids. 

There is death and hardship everywhere. The film ends the way it started. The scene with his daughter. Filmed from a different angle, we can now see their faces. We now know that this is the moment when he dies. He drifts off into death.

GENRE: Drama
READER: Steven Murphy

LOGLINE

A mysterious outbreak of blindness sweeps through a futuristic city sending hundreds into quarantine where they are forced to fend for themselves while the government tries to stem the outbreak.

COMMENTS

Beautiful, poetic and moving, the concept allows for some incredibly poignant, cinematic moments while also presenting the horrors and cruelty of man, but ultimately, offers a hopeful resolution and an affirmation of spirit.  Mereilles is a great choice as director, and this is an A list project even without the cast attached. 

SUMMARY

Faced with a mysterous outbreak of blindness, governmental authorities quarantine the affected individuals in an abandoned mental hospital.  As more patients arrive each day, the hospital cannot properly accommodate the and systems begin to break down,  food is scarce, toilets are backed up, and the dead lay unburied.  The nightmare grows worse when a rebellious inmate (the self proclaimed KING OF WARD THREE) resorts to unspeakable violence to take control of the hospital and the food rations for himself.  

Fortunately for the other victims, a level headed doctor and his devoted wife take charge, the wife’s secret vision help to overthrow the King in a brutal fight (she stabs him in the neck while he rapes female inmates. 

The doctor’s wife leads the others out of the ward and helps them find food in a world overrun by the blind, before leading them back to their luxurious apartment and letting the other victims share food, water and shelter.  When the first victim’s sight returns, the others are heartened by his cries of “I can see,” and one by one, hope is restored.

LOGLINE

A low level CIA agent gets fired.  He decides to write a memoir which falls into the  wrong hands, and a pair of misguided amateur crooks try to blackmail the agent and threaten to sell his “secrets” to the Russians.

COMMENTS

Really funny script with strong parts for Pitt and Clooney, and with  Coen bros direction its sure to be a hilarious film – which is one of Mirjam’s favorite scripts at the market.  There are several laugh out loud moments, and we’ve been quoting it back and forth to each other all week.  “Agent, agent!” Recommended.

SUMMARY

OSBORNE COX, a career CIA analyst with a level three clearance gets fired out of the blue. “You’ve got a drinking problem… you’re a mormon, next to you we all have a drinking problem!” Osbourne prepares to tell his wife KATIE the bad news, but she ignores him and prepares for a dinner party, which her lover HARRY, a lactose intolerant federal marshall, is attending.  When Osbourne finally breaks the news to Katie, she is livid.   When he explains that he thinks he wants to write a memoir, it fails to mollify her. 

Across town at a D.C. gym called HARDBODIES, LINDA LITZKE is unhappy with her life and wants to reinvent herself with a series of costly plastic surgeries.  Her “can do” buddy CHAD, a personal trainer, encourages her, and even helps her judge her prospective dates from online personals. 

When a gym employee finds a CD of what appears to be national secrets (it’s actually a copy of Osbourne’s manuscript) Chad and Linda see it as their ticket to a big payday (and Linda thinks it can help pay for some of her surgeries.) Chad insists that they will get a reward for returning the cd, “like a good Samaritan tax, which really isn’t a tax because its, you know, voluntary.” 

When Chad and Linda call Osborne (Chad gets a computer buddy to track him down via a digital imprint on the cd) Osborne erupts and threatens them.  Linda stands up to him and quickly Chad and Linda find themselves embroiled in a blackmail scheme.  “A couple of clowns somehow got ahold of my memoir.” 

Harry answers an online personal and begins dating Linda, (while his wife Sandy is out of town… he also keeps his relationship with Linda a secret from Katie, his other clandestine lover…)

Linda and Chad rendevous at a drop point, hoping to extort money from Osbourne, but he refuses to pay and threatens them again and punches Chad in the face.  Linda, in a rage, smashes the back of his car before she and Chad speed off. 

Linda decides to bring the CD to the Russian embassy and sell it.  KRAPOTKIN, the Russian agent whom she speaks to is more confused than intrigued. “This is just a taste.” “How do I contact you? We work at Hardbodies… ask for Chad... or Linda.”

Linda talks Chad into breaking into Osbourne’s house to find more material.  While Chad is rummaging through, Harry walks in (after having sex with Osbourne’s wife Katie).  Harry finds Chad lurking in the closet and shoots him in the face, killing.  Harry throws the body in the river. 

Linda gets upset when Chad disappears, and further upset when Krapotkin tells her the material on the CD is “drivel.” Harry promises to help her find Chad, but when he realizes she’s talking about the guy he shot in the face, he becomes paranoid and convinced she’s got shady government ties… “who are you?  I’m Linda Lutzke.”

Seeing Linda upset makes her manager at the gym, TED, very upset.  Ted tries to help by breaking into Osborne’s house to steal more material for her to sell.  Osborne finds Ted, thinks he’s behind the blackmail, and shoots him.  Ted dies.  Osborne gets attacked by FBI agents and winds up in a coma.  Harry disappears to Venezuela.  The CIA, who think they’re sitting on something big, cut a deal with Linda to keep her mouth shut, and she uses the money for her surgeries.  The CIA, though, have no idea what any of this mess was all about.

The turning point in her adolescence is a sharp one; sent into the world by her father on a mission, Hanna journeys stealthily across North Africa and Europe while eluding agents and underground thugs who report to a ruthless intelligence operative with secrets of her own.  As she nears her ultimate target, Hanna not only must face off against powerful enemies, but she most also confront startling revelations about her very own existence.  
","Universal will release in UK, Latin America, Australia",,Screening Footage,*B ,,,,"LOGLINE:
A young girl lives in the finnish woods and is trained in hand to hand combat and educated by her father; never glimpsing the outside world.  When she is “ready” her father lets her choose to begin the mission she’s been preparing for; attacking a mysterious woman.

COMMENTS:
Nearly as cerebral as an action movie can get; but there are several sequences that don’t feel particularly smart at all.  A lot of the story is downright corny; like the super soldier reveal, the “switch” that alerts Marissa, and the interaction between HANNA and SOPHIE; the dialog where Hanna’s quirkiness and lack of real world knowledge is downright poor.  The chase feels overly prolonged, Marissa’s character is thin and the 14 year old girl as super killer premise doesn’t really reach its full potential.  The script starts off slow and builds; with a promise of something exciting and revelatory to come, but falls short.  It’s also a weirdly positioned movie; too oddball for mainstream, and not smart enough to be called smarthouse.

SUMMARY:
HANNA, 14, hunts a deer; killing it and butchering it like a pro; she trains with her father, ERIK, who teaches her hand to hand combat, multiple foreign languages and marksmanship.   HANNA is growing so strong
that she eventually defeats him in a fight.  The two are running over ice in an exercise and Hanna breaks through the ice and falls in. Erik saves her, but Hanna is upset; not that she nearly died, but that she required his help, “I would have found a way.”

Erik holds a gun to her head while she sleeps; she wakes, and violently disarms him and gets the upper hand.  “I’m ready.”

Erik presents her with a switch; if she hits the switch it will “tell Marissa Wiegler where we are, and she’ll never give up until you’re dead.”After a few days of hesitation, Hanna hits the button, whispering, “come and find me.”

30 US special forces troops invade the forest; Erik kills two of them and gets away. They take Hanna into custody.

Hanna asks her captors to see Marissa. Marissa, watching on CCTV, sends in an imposter, whom Hanna promptly kills. Believing she’s completed her mission by killing Marissa, Hanna kills several guards and escapes the compound, finding herself in the Moroccan desert.  She befriends a traveling family; meeting a girl her own age, SOPHIE. Hanna stows away in their car and makes her way to a camping village in Spain.

Meanwhile, Marissa engineers a two pronged chase; sending government forces after ERIK, “he’s the more immediate threat,” and hiring a private killer, ISAAC, to chase down Hanna.  ISAAC and his men find Hanna at the Spanish campground and begin chasing the family.

Hanna and Sophie go on a date with a couple Spaniards; Hanna, for the first time in her life listens to great music and nearly gets kissed by a boy, but as he approaches, her muscle memory kicks in and she throws him to the ground. “It’s been nice.”

The killers, Isaac and his men Razor and Titch, tail the family as they drive in their minivan; Hanna tells them they’re in danger and makes a run for it; she gets in a fight and manages to overpower Razor and escape.
Sophie’s entire family get apprehended. Marissa interrogates them; Sophie’s little brother MILES tells Marissa that Hanna is planning to rendezvous with her father at “Grimm’s House” a museum dedicated to the author of Grimm’s Fairy Tales.

When Hanna arrives, she is disappointed that her father is not there, but a comrade, KNEPFLER, gives her word from her father, as well as a pamphlet containing money and new ID papers.  Shortly after her arrival, Marissa, Isaac and the others arrive.  Hanna hides; but Knepfler gets tortured for info.  He doesn’t reveal Hanna’s whereabouts. Hanna is shocked that Marissa is still alive; and shocked to hear that Erik isn’t her real father.

Hanna digs around for information on the internet that leads her to her mother’s apartment; she finds her grandmother’s dead body. The old woman had been killed by Marissa.

Erik comes into the apartment and tries to explain; he tells her that he’d been part of a government organization trying to create supersoldiers and that he’d recruited her mother “at an abortion clinic.”

Marissa gives chase again; Erik gets shot, but heroically distracts them, allowing Hanna to escape.

Hanna guns down Marissa.

Hanna returns to the Finnish woods; grabs an old encyclopedia and her father’s coat and heads off on her own.

 An adaptation of the Charlotte Bronte classic, about an orphaned woman who grows up to be a governess and winds up falling in love with the troubled master of the estate. 
 
COMMENTS: 
For starters, I’ll admit to being something of a philistine in that I’ve never actually seen any other versions of Jane Eyre, nor have I ever read the book… so Mirjam will weigh in regarding how faithful or divergent the script is to the source material.  The script on its own is quite long; bordering on tedious at roughly 120 pages all told. It reads like a movie with a two hour plus running time, and the strange thing about the pacing is that the resolution seems rushed; as if the screenwriter ran out of room and had to cram five scenes into one quick montage.  The sloppy ending stuck out like a sore thumb, and the other major flaw was the relationship between two leads failed to pull at my heartstrings enough; as a result I think this script needs some work. The director is superb, so I still think that this could be a very interesting project; and the story itself (courtesy of ms. Bronte) was enthralling; I loved the supernatural ghost story aspect, and often the writing was fresh, brisk and exciting, but on the whole I’d say it’s not polished enough to prove its merit as an awards caliber project; which is the pedigree it needs as a project like this. Needs work, but still a consider. 
 
SUMMARY:
JANE runs through the moors in a storm; she sees a young red headed girl who appears in the distance like a vision; Jane bangs on the door of a house, but gets the door slammed in her face. ST JOHN picks her up in his arms.  ST JOHN brings her inside; they inquire as to her name but she passes out. 
 
FLASHBACK: Jane is ten years old. JANE gets into a fight with a bullying older cousin and gets sent to a room alone for punishment. She sees a ghostlike apparition in a mirror and lets out a terrifying scream. 
 
JANE’S AUNT; MRS REED arranges to have her sent to a religious boarding school. Jane lashes out at MRS REED, accusing her of being cruel and tortuous in her persistence in sending Jane to the haunted ‘red room.’ 
 
JANE’S treatment at the school is almost torturous, but she befriends a single girl, HELEN, who helps her get through; but Helen is tortured so badly at the school she winds up dying; and she is the ghostly vision whom Jane later sees on the moors. 
 
END FLASHBACK. 
 
ST JOHN helps JANE find a job as a governess at Thornfield; for a young girl, ADELE.  JANE is happy for the job, despite the solitude and low wages. 
 
ADELE warns Jane that there’s a “ghostly woman” roaming the house who will bite you and suck your blood.  Jane is chilled, but thinks the child is telling tales. 
 
While taking a walk, Jane startles ROCHESTER; the man of the house, who falls and twists his ankle. He’s a grumpy fellow and their initial meeting could not go worse; he seems to taunt and scold her.  
 
JANE wakes from a nightmare and finds MR ROCHESTER’s room on fire; she rousts him from bed; “saving his life.”  He tries to seduce her, but she heads back to her room. 
 
JANE is upset to find in the morning that Mr. Rochester has left without so much as a good bye. He returns after a brief absence with a large party, throwing poor MRS FAIRFAX into a tizzy as she prepares for their arrival.  Jane is disappointed to see that he has returned with BLANCHE: a dashing young woman. 
 
Rochester pulls her aside and reprimands her for not saying hello to him; he sees that she’s been upset during his absence.   She remains reserved and proper, which hurts his feelings.
 
During the middle of the night; all the guests are woken by a scream. Rochester assures them that everything is alright, but secretly brings Jane upstairs where she is shocked to find one of Rochester’s friends, MASON, badly injured and bleeding profusely. He mentions a mysterious female attacker, but Rochester refuses to tell Jane the attackers identity. “You were not in danger.” 
 
Rochester attempts to confess feelings for Jane but she misunderstands him and believes he is telling her that he is falling for Blanche.  Jane gets a letter from Gateshead; her cousin JOHN REED has squandered his fortune and commited suicide and her (cruel) aunt has requested her presence.  Rochester gives Jane leave, and her wages for the journey, but begs her return quickly. 
 
Her aunt, near death, confesses to Jane that Jane’s uncle has been looking for her; ready to give her an inheritance, but the Aunt lied to him and claimed Jane had died of typhus.  Jane forgives the mean old woman. 
 
Jane writes to her uncle; telling him that she’s alive and looking forward to their possible meeting. 
 
Jane returns to Rochester’s, where she finds that he’s preparing to marry Blanche.  She tells him that she must leave, and he argues with her, until he finally admits that he has feelings for her and asks her to marry; she is shocked, she doesn’t believe him, but eventually she relents and falls into his arms. She’s so happy she feels as if she’s in a fairy tale, but her bliss is interrupted by a terrifying vision; a mysterious woman appears and tears Jane’s wedding veil in half. Rochester admits there’s something strange in the house and that he’ll tell her about it a “year and a day” after their wedding. 
 
On their wedding day; a man, BRIGGS, bursts into the church to break up the ceremony, claiming that ROCHESTER has a “wife still living!” 
 
Rochester admits the truth and leads Jane and the wedding party to the attic of his mansion where he reveals BERTHA MASON; his crazy wife who’s been under the care of a nurse for fifteen years; hidden away.  Rochester has tried to live as is she never existed. 
 
He begs Jane to forgive him and love him, but she cannot. She manages to lock him out of her room and climb down the balustrade; escaping to her cabin. 
 
ST JOHN arrives at her door with the shocking news that she has inherited a fortune from her uncle.  Jane moves in with John and his sisters.  Her happiness is short-lived; as she is surprised by ST JOHN’s cold feelings towards her. He proposes marriage and asks her to join him on a mission to India; she turns him down and decides to find Rochester, but upon her return to Thornfield she finds a vast, blackened ruin. 
 
Mrs. Fairfax tells her that MRS ROCHESTER burned down the house and jumped to her death. Rochester was badly burned in the fire. Jane finds him and reunites with him; they kiss.

Title: One Day

Loglline: Story follows the lives of one couple on the same day over a period of 20 years. 

Comments: I am a big fan of the director. I think I would want to distribute anything she is involved with. That is why I was a bit disappointed by this script. It starts out strong, I very much enjoyed the first half, but it start to loose steam. It becomes repetitive and obvious. Sorry to spoil it for you, but when they finally get together, the female lead dies. Then the story goes on a bit longer with the main character finding a deeper relationship with is daughter from his first marriage. The pay-off does feel unsatisfying. I am also not crazy about Jim Sturges as the handsome and irresistible Dexter. He has never struck me as to die for, and I am not sure other women will. Anne Hathaway with a British accent doesn't convince me either. This is definitely a must read though and worth strong consideration. 


Synopsis:
The episodic story takes place during a single day each year for two decades in the lives of Dex and Em. Dexter, the louche public school boy, and Emma, the brainy Yorkshire lass, meet the day they graduate from university in 1988 and run circles around one another for the next 20 years. Dex becomes a TV presenter whose life of sex, booze, and drugs spins out of control, while Em dully slogs her way through awful jobs before becoming the author of young adult books. They each take other lovers and spouses, but they cannot really live without each other.

TITLE: Beyond a Reasonable Doubt
DIRECTOR:  Peter Hyams
WRITER: Peter Hyams
CAST: TBA
STATUS:  In Development
GENRE: Thriller/Procedural 
READER: Christopher Kubasik / comments Steven Murphy
 

LOGLINE: A Peabody winning reporter going nowhere fast in the Atlanta local news market frames himself for a murder in order to expose the crooked ways of a bad district attorney.


COMMENTS:   JC’s plan starts raising eyebrows almost immediately (because its idiotic and suicidal).  Hence, the eventual TWIST that JC is actually a ruthless manipulator and murderer is less surpising than it is relieving… at least the guy isn’t a complete moron.  For a film with such a dark underlying premise, the tone feels more like THE ANCHORMAN than a Lumet film; and the rapid change is unnerving and uneven. Whether meant to be a scathing satire of the media, an indictment of the US justice system or just a clever black comedy with a twist, the film comes up short on all levels. 

 
SUMMARY: J.C., a local reporter who’s beat sees him reporting on different brands of coffees, dreams of a big political expose and his gut tells him there's something questionable about the D.A, HUNTER's long winning streak which almost always involves circumstantial evidence mixed with suspiciously (possibly planted) DNA traces.  JC suspects Hunter and his former partner, Det. MERCHANT, plant the DNA evidencein order to assure convictions.  JC concocts a plan to reveal the conspiracy by implicating himself in a murder and chronicling the ease with which the corrupt DA finds DNA evidence, planning to show the 'documentary' his producer FINLEY has made of them staging the wrong evidence.  This would call into question all of Hunter’s previous convictions.  J.C. and Finley hear about a murder of a prostitute and set the plan in action. J.C. leaves circumstantial evidence that implicates him in the murder.  He's arrested.  Merchant catches on to what their plan and kills Finley,  taking the copies of the DVDs that clear J.C. J.C. begs his lover, ELLA, the assistant D.A. to track down the trail of false clues J.C. created...  But she also discovers J.C. actually faked the documentary he made years ago that won him that Peabody.  In fact, he hired a prostitute and fed her lines to as he created her moving story.  In recent months the woman had been hounding J.C., blackmailing him, and threatening to reveal him as a fake.  He in fact KILLED the prostitute, and was using the recent ploy to expose Hunter's illicit tactics, get rid of his blackmailer and possibly win another journalism award as well. Ella confronts J.C. and leaves him in jail, where he is left sitting on death row.

",,,,,,,,"LOGLINE:
GAVIN stands on the ledge of a high rise building and seems determined to take his own  life.  Enter a detective, HOLLIS, who has been sent to talk the “jumper” out of it, but has  just inherited reasons of his own to jump off a building. In the end, it’s Gavin who has to  convince the policeman that his own life is worth living. 

COMMENTS:
Film is structured like a stage play, with much of the action being confined to static locations – the ledge, their respective apartments – and the dialog is meant to carry the story.  The device works fairly well, and the dialog is better than average, offering occasional insights into the debate between science and religion, faith and reason… but the religious theme becomes a burden on the story.  Similarly, Joe’s character is extremely over the top.  He is not scary so much as he is depressing, and his vicious explosion at the end isn’t surprising at all.  Ultimately, the story is completely implausible because of one major flaw – the filmmakers insert a ticking clock by making Gavin have to jump by noon, giving Hollis only an hour to get to the bottom of the reason why Gavin is being forced to kill himself.  Unfortunately, it makes no sense that Gavin and Hollis would have a rather leisurely conversation recounting all the details that led up to Shana’s kidnapping as the precious minutes dwindle down.  Hollis should have been snapping his fingers and shouting “get to the point” the entire story.  If Gavin had simply told Hollis that Joe had kidnapped Shana, everything would have worked out fine, as it only took the cops three minutes to find Joe after Gavin finally revealed that the man was behind it.  

SUMMARY:
GAVIN wakes up and looks at a handwritten note reminding him to kill himself.  HOLLIS, a veteran cop, goes to a fertility clinic hoping to help a family friend conceive a child, but is shocked to find out that he is completely infertile, something that wouldn’t be so troubling if it weren’t for the fact that he already has children.

GAVIN goes to an abandoned apartment and gets onto the ledge, peering nervously over the edge.   Hollis is dispatched to talk him down – his specialty on the police force is dealing with “jumpers.”  Hollis is good at his job, and despite the devastating news he received this morning, he rallies and manages to begin conversing with Gavin, who eventually admits “if I don’t jump by noon, someone else is gonna die.”  Gavin begins at the beginning, telling Hollis the tale of his relationship with SHANA.

Gavin’s FB – Gavin meets SHANA, a beautiful neighbor of his who lives down the hall from him, and also happens to attend one of his college classes (he is a professor).  Shana and Gavin get along, but there are two major barriers to their romance – while Gavin is anti religion, Shana is a devout Christian.  She is also married.  Her husband JOE invites Gavin and his gay roommate CHRIS over for dinner one night, mistakenly thinking that the pair are lovers. Joe begins preaching about hell and  damnation and condemns homosexuality. Gavin is offended by Joe’s preaching (even more than Chris was) and storms out.  

At class, Shana apologizes for her husband’s bigotry.  Gavin asks her out, but she tells him that they need to play it coy, and arranges to “accidentally” run into him in the park.  They share beers and have a nice time, but the conversation begins to seem like a bit of an argument, with Gavin revealing his true heresy and railing against the hypocrisy of organized religion and the preachings of the bible. 

Hollis listens to Gavin’s story politely, but feels very uncomfortable listening to Gavin’s tale of wooing another man’s wife.

Hollis’s FB – Earlier that morning, Hollis comes home from the fertility clinic and confronts his wife.  He holds a gun into his own mouth and threatens to kill himself if she doesn’t reveal the identity of the children’s father.

GAVIN’s FB - Shana and Gavin start to get more serious, their dalliances beginning to get passionate.  Her husband Joe begins to get suspicious.  Gavin and Shana go to a Howard Johnson’s.  Joe follows them to the motel, but hears a bunch of people having afternoon trists, and cannot figure out which room his wife is in.  Gavin is very passionate with Shana (Joe doesn’t normally please her) and Shana has a wild orgasm.  

Thinking that Joe has gone out, they have sex in Gavin’s apartment.  Joe catches them, but rather than breaking in and confronting them, he jerks off in the hallway while listening to his wife have sex.

Hollis realizes that his brother is the father of his child.  Gavin tries to convince him that his wife did it because she loves him.

Joe confronts Gavin, engaging him in yet another theological debate, but this time there is a gun sitting on a bible on the table next to Joe.  Gavin doesn’t back down, even when Joe reveals that he knows about the affair.  

Joe kidnaps Shana and forces Gavin to kill himself, claiming that if Gavin doesn’t jump off the ledge by noon, Shana will die. 

Gavin finally reveals this last piece to Hollis only a few minutes before noon.  Cops burst into an apartment across the street and manage to abduct Joe and save Shana, but it’s too late… Gavin jumps to his death.

Hollis decides to go back to his wife, realizing that no matter who is the biological father, he is the children’s true dad.

LOGLINE: Five years after his wife and unborn daughter die in a senseless accident, PAUL THOMAS enlists the help of his best friend and a woman he met in a bar to swim the length of the Hudson River; the last thing he's decided to do before taking his own life.

SM COMMENTS: 

A touching character piece that threatened to become either maudlin or overly saccharine but was written with a deft touch, by a writer with a sense of humor and a deft ear for dialog.  If directed well, it could have the same feel as Kenneth Lonergan’s YOU CAN COUNT ON ME; a tale about genuine, troubled people struggling with severe loss.  My major reservation about this project is that the cast is disappointing: I don’t see Fiennes having nearly the charisma to carry such a small, character driven piece.  The audience for a project like this is limited as well; it’s kind of like a chick flick for guys.  
 
SUMMARY: 

PAUL THOMAS and AMY are a happy, humorous couple expecting their first child, but tragedy strikes when Amy is struck by a car, killing her and the unborn child in an instant.  Five years later Paul approaches his best friend, JEFF, with a strange proposition: Paul wants to swim the length of the Hudson River, while Jeff pilots a boat along with him.  Jeff, looking for a chance to get away from his angry wife, agrees.  Jeff invites LIZ, an attractive school teacher who used to waitress where Jeff tends bar.  The three drive upstate from Manhattan, buy a boat, and begin the journey.  Along the way, Paul lets slip that this is all part of his plan to honor and finish a promise he made to Jeff years ago.  Three months after Amy’s death, Paul climbed to the ledge of his building and  planned to kill himself.  Jeff managed to talk him down by promising to wait five years to see if the grief would end; Jeff promised that if at the end of the five years, Paul still wanted to die, Jeff would “buy the razors.” The five years is up, and this swim is Paul’s last hurrah. Jeff is stunned and Liz confused, but the pair have no choice but to continue the journey. Along the way they meet locals as they travel and camp along the river, make a stop Liz's family house, and argue over the wisdom of Paul's choice of life over death.  Paul and Liz grow more and more relaxed with each other, and despite his admission that he “has no more love, no more hope,” she falls for him and they sleep together.   After 150 miles of swimming, Paul finally crosses the southern tip of Manhattan.  Despite Jeff and Liz’s pleas, Paul insists that he's going to keep swimming out into the ocean.  Jeff tries to chase his friend, but Liz holds him back, leaving Paul to make the decision for himself.  The film ends with the two friends watching Paul swim away.

TITLE: Black Oasis
DIRECTOR: Stephen Elliot
WRITER: Stephen Elliot
CAST: 
STATUS: In Development
GENRE: Biopic
READER: Steven Murphy

LOGLINE

Based on the story of B movie starlet Susan Cabot, who gave up her career to raise her son, but winds up poisoning his love for her by forcing him  to undergo an experimental Hormone therapy to help him grow.   The hormones and excessive mothering leave him a bit taller, but nearly “retarded” and the troubled child turns against his mother and eventually kills her.

COMMENTS

An interesting premise, but the story is bogged down by far too many flashbacks and intercut footage from Susan’s work.  To make matters worse, Susan’s character is completely psychotic and unappealing and the film is incredibly dark and depressing.  Films about show business are tough (Mirjam particularly dislikes them) and this one is saddled by the burden of being an overwhelming downer as well. Pass.


SUMMARY

Film opens on police busting into Susan Cabot’s run down mansion and finding her master bedroom splattered with blood, while a mysterious figure huddles in the corner crying.

FLASHBACK – SUSAN CABOT, a beautiful, but very short actress starts in a Roger Corman film.  She plays the “wasp woman” which (for good or bad) will be her most notorious.

Susan buys a big house.  Her mother MURIEL (who has a history of mental illness) moves in, and is skeptical about the new place, but Susan insists that it will be their new “Oasis.”

At a charity event, Susan meets young MICHAEL a bedridden kid who instantly falls in love with her.  Years later, he moves to Hollywood works as a waiter at one of her parties, where he gets jealous hearing about all of her conquests, Bogie, Brando, Dean, and more jealous when she goes home with the KING OF JORDAN, with whom she will have a brief affair.  

Susan has a son, Tobias, who is rumored to be the son of the King.  Susan retires from acting to raise her son, teaching acting courses a few evenings a week.  Michael enrolls in one of her classes and the two fall in love, start sleeping together and get married in Vegas.  

Susan dotes on both Tobias and Michael, and tries to get Michael to stay home at all times, but he insists on working.  Tobias begins to come down with strange seizures, and Michael is enraged to find out that Susan has known about her son’s illness for years, but kept it a secret from Michael.  

Dr. Robb tells them that Tobias’s growth is stunted and suggests radical hormone therapy.  “This could be the end of short people.” Michael is hesitant, but Susan gung ho, and Tobias undergoes the dangerous treatment.  Susan lives with her son in the hospital and grows suspicious that Michael is having an affair.  

The news breaks that the procedure is a success (though Tobias has only grown a bit).  A few years later, the marriage has completely fallen apart, and Michael leaves Susan.  Tobias grows up mentally inept, due to Susan’s overly protective parenting and the excessive drugs and at 22 he lives at home and works at McDonald’s, being forced to sneak away if he wants to speak to Michael.

After a horribly embarrassing evening at a movie screening which Susan believed to be held in her honor, but wound up to be a roast, mother and son get in a vicious fight, and Tobias kills her.

COMMENTS

Doc is beautifully shot, but often painfully dull.  The story is interesting, but isn’t presented with a powerful through line, with the on screen action failing to capture many poignant moments or stories.  The context and idea – a former Thai boxing champion turned Buddhist monk partners with a local nun to raise orphan boys – is very strong, but the doc failed to capture their story very well – it didn’t form strong bonds with any of the child characters, didn’t focus on a particularly interesting time in the world of this monastery/ orphanage, and wound up feeling like a beautifully shot advertisement.

COMMENTS 
Read half and don’t need to read more; this is officially the THIRD quirky Superhero project of this market, and this one is far less interesting than the other two. Not prebuy by any stretch; it’s got the earmarks of indie stereotypes, featuring an inexplicably weird lead character who falls in love with an equally weird girl, presumably accompanied by alt rock.  “Action” sequences don’t compel, romance is flat… Pass.

COMMENTS:
Interesting, but dry and fairly impersonal, we never get enough of the central story to overcome the sense that it’s all one big history lesson.  The love story seems to be there solely to support the historical narrative, giving a sense of the personal tragedies surrounding historical events, but failing to deliver emotional impact or the necessary high stakes.  That said, the history is interesting and well laid out, but the characters are too numerous and shallowly drawn to be truly engaging.  Pass.

SUMMARY:
Opening in Jerusalem in 1944, we see a man killed in public by two Zionists.  A voiceover tells us that this man was TOM WILKINS, and brings us through a history of the Zionist movement in the early 20th century, accompanied by newsreel-style footage.  It sets the scene, describing Jewish-Arab violence as Jewish immigration increases, and ends with the rise of the Irgun, a Zionist extremist group, out of opposition to Socialist Zionism and a resentment towards British occupation of Palestine.  We also meet SHOSHANNA BOROCHOV, daughter of Zionism’s founder David Borochov.  SHOSHANNA works with The Jewish Agency, an organization closely tied to propaganda and dealing with the British.  The Jewish Agency encourages young Jewish women to socialize with the Brits.

In the aftermath of an Irgun bank robbery in the mid-1930’s, WILKINS and his boss, CAIRNS (both members of the British Crime Investigation Department in Palestine) question a captured suspect about the identity and whereabouts of AVRAHAM STERN, leader of the Tel Aviv Irgun.

Later, at a party, WILKINS introduces SHOSHANNA, his girlfriend, to his co-workers and we see the general ease of relations between the Brits and the Zionists, despite the sensitive issues at stake.

The voiceover and newsreel continues, showing the increasing militarization of the Jews in Palestine, the rise of civilian terrorism on both Jewish and Arab sides, and introduces us to the new British Police Superintendant, MORTON.

As the violence increases and the Brits are forced to take a harder stand against the Irgun, SHOSHANNA and WILKINS’ relationship becomes a bit strained.  WILKINS asks SHOSHANNA to marry him, but she asks for time to think about it.  They remain together, but feel out-of-place in each other’s social lives.  When Great Britain places limits on Jewish immigration to Palestine, the Irgun responds by targeting British officers.  CAIRNS is killed in a bomb attack, but STERN is captured and interrogated by WILKINS, eventually to be released for lack of evidence.

On the outbreak of WWII, all the Zionist organizations except the Irgun declare amnesty with Britain in order to oppose Hitler.  The Irgun remains dogmatic and under new leadership continue their campaign.  WILKINS is questioned by the British leadership about his ties to SHOSHANNA and her friends, and their relationship begins to falter.

A bomb attack aimed at WILKINS kills several British officers and the Brits scramble to catch up with the Irgun.  When they eventually trace STERN and catch up to him, he is shot and killed by MORTON, ostensibly because he tried to escape.  MORTON and his family return to England on leave after a failed retaliatory bombing attempt, while WILKINS says goodbye to SHOSHANNA, having been transferred to Jerusalem against SHOSHANNA’s misgivings.  Not long after, WILKINS is shot and killed by the Irgun, and the voiceover/newsreel cuts in to show us how the formation of Israel played out.  The film ends with a brief interview of DAVID SHOMRON, the Irgun member who shot WILKINS.

A teenaged boy living with his mother in Singapore temporarily moves in with his grandparents and discovers that the process of aging can resurrect the past.  When his grandfather dies, he gets closer to his grandmother, hoping to find answers about his dead father that can help him through his own adolescence.

COMMENTS:
A dreamy coming-of-age story that sets a nice tone, but leaves us unfulfilled.  Much of the movie is about En’s attempts to learn more about his father and the past, but all we are left with is a vague feeling about the unreliability of memory and its muddled effect on the present. Good writing and smooth transitions, but ultimately lacks real depth.  Pass.

SUMMARY:
XIANG EN is moving out of his bedroom for its renovation and is nearly caught masturbating by his MOTHER.  MOTHER drops him off at his grandparents’ house and leaves on vacation with her boyfriend, WILSON.  EN watches old home movies that he has digitized on his computer and his GRANDPA takes notice.  GRANDPA digs out some old photos of EN’s father as a student leader during protests in the 60’s. EN had no idea his father was an activist.  EN’s GRANDMA appears disoriented and often mistakes EN for his father.

EN spends more time with his GRANDPA, going to check out a nursing home by the sea and looking at old photos.  At his bartending job, EN sees his hot neighbor YING drunkenly repel the attentions of a guy.  EN helps her home and returns to his grandparents’ house to discover that his GRANDPA has passed away.

At the memorial service, GRANDMA is clearly disoriented, asking where her husband is and mistaking EN for his father.  EN asks his mother about his father’s past, but MOTHER isn’t very forthcoming, saying she didn’t meet him until their 30’s.  GRANDMA moves into EN’s room at home and a few days later, EN sees a dragonfly land on her hand.

EN begins tutoring YING in English, but finds himself distracted, especially when he catches a glimpse of her naked from his window across the way.  At the club he works at, he asks his friend ANDY about the Singapore riots and celebrates his birthday by finally getting together with YING.

Back at home, GRANDMA seems to be living more and more in the past, and EN hears her reenact an argument she had with GRANDPA about EN’s father.  One day, while EN and YING are having sex in her room next door, GRANDMA manages to leave the house and get lost.  MOTHER sees EN and YING from EN’s room and when GRANDMA is found, MOTHER is furious with EN.  EN argues with her, telling her that GRANDMA should be in a nursing home, it was GRANDPA’s idea.  MOTHER slaps him and EN leaves home to stay at his grandparents’ old place.  A couple days later YING tells EN that GRANDMA is now at the nursing home.

EN visits GRANDMA and tries to get more information about his father.  She tells him to leave the past in peace but a few days later, after deciphering an old letter of his father’s, EN returns and takes GRANDMA out of the nursing home.  They drive over the causeway to Malaysia and visit his father’s grave.  GRANDMA mistakes EN for his father and they drive back to Singapore.

EN moves back in with his mother and she watches the old home movies with him.  Soon after, she brings him in for his compulsory period of military service.  We last see EN leaving sentry duty on the base.  He visits the beach, and when we see a dragonfly land on him, we know his GRANDMA has died.

A retiree goes on a hunt for his old working papers from jobs he’d work decades ago in order to ensure he gets his proper benefits; and along the way encounters a bizarre series of people.

COMMENTS
This is a very strange script; I was enjoying it quite thoroughly at the outset, there was a humor in Mammuth’s desperation and even his craggy wife was an amusing character.  It’s a road movie in the truest sense; the plot is more like a series of small vignettes that get progressively stranger. By the end of the film the weirdness overwhelmed the writing and I frankly got lost.  A lot of details and “facts” seemed to blur because of a great deal of hallucinatory imagery, and I felt confused.  It’s in post, so it would be worth checking out the footage – script has merit, it just lost me along the way.  Absolutely only for arthouse. Good role for Depardieu. Will mostly appeal to French speaking territories and ones where French films are particularly strong.

SUMMARY
MAMMUTH retires after a decade of working at a Pork production factory; a party is thrown in his honor and his is given a picture puzzle as a parting gift.  His wife CATHERINE is not impressed. “They sure didn’t spare their considerations for you!”

MAMMUTH is not sure what to do with himself in retirement, and his wife is jealous of his leisure time, upset that she has to continue working in a supermarket.

Catherine realizes that Mammuth does not have all of his paperwork documenting his years and years of work in an assortment of menial jobs, and Mammuth is forced to take a road trip to into his past, to ensure he receives the proper retirement benefits.  “Hang in there, with my papers and all the future money you’ll be able to stop working there.”

Mammuth gets his papers from an old job as a Gravedigger but crashes his motorcycle… “I’m not dead.”  Mammuth heads to a night club where he used to be a bouncer, but the employee is a jerk, so Mammuth breaks into the office and steals his papers.

Mammuth goes to a fairground to get his papers from a job he’d worked as a carnival operator, but the boss refuses to give him his papers, so Mammuth takes out his frustration in the bumper cars.

Mammuth stays at a hostel and gets hustled by a scrap metal collector who talks Mammuth into working on a scheme but rips him off.

His luck takes another turn for the worse when he makes the mistake of allowing PRETTY GIRL into his room; he falls asleep and she robs him.

MAMMUTH has bizarre interactions with “WHITE LADY,” a former girlfriend of his whom now visits him in his mind.

MAMMUTH visits his relatives and stays with his niece MISS MING.  The two of them brighten each other’s lives; he stands up for her after she fails at a job interview and he throws her a really bizarre party; she is quite artistic, and inspires him to reinvigorate his
life. He throws away his retirement papers “long live death!”

He returns to his wife and the two tearfully embrace. Mammuth’s ex love, the WHITE LADY, we find out has spent forty years in a coma (presumably from an accident MAMMUTH was involved in). She passes away.

In a romantic comedy, a man and a woman are in love but have nothing in common. So despite the depth of their feelings, they separate only to get back together again. This is what happens to Mary and Adam. Only they're not the usual 20 or 30 years old, they're both over 60. Elegant and dynamic sixty something of our times. The kind that can deal with children, grandchildren, work and friends with all their joys and sorrow. Until the day they realize they are now part of the senior’s category.... to their great surprise.

SUMMARY:
ADAM, 60 year old British man and MARIE, his 55 year old wife (a French Native) go on a trip to France; their romance is still clearly alive, but MARIE is troubled by a realization that her memory is starting to falter. She has trouble recalling many recent events, but her long-term memory is seemingly fine. 

ADAM is an architect researching a new development; his financier RICHARD wants to build a retirement community that doubles as a swinger’s village.  “You'll see, we're going to invent a world where young people will want to grow old.”

ADAM gets honored with an award for his architecture work in the seventies and eighties; and is hailed as a father of the “transportation revolution” but ironically, the ceremony coincides with the demolition of one of his buildings. 

As her sixtieth birthday approaches, MARY starts to get quite panicked about entering old age. Her doctor tells her to get more exercise so she goes to a YMCA and is distraught when she’s placed in an old people class; she’s also realizing that guys no longer stop to stare at her. She meets one man at the gym, PETER, who makes her day by making a pass at her. 

She turns to Adam for empathy, and when he doesn’t respond she lashes out. “Don't you get it, Adam? That Royal Institute Award was your tombstone! Your transportation revolution happened 30 years ago.”

Mary’s insult seems to send Adam into a spiral as well, and he rebels against his “old age” by trying to win the contract to design the TATE MODERN; it’s the “it” project and the odds of him winning the contract are quite slim.  MARY is annoyed that he’s trying to recapture his youth rather than accept old age. 

They both handle their aging in completely opposing manners: while ADAM starts working with the young architects in his firm, and indeed, reading YOUNG ARCHITECT MAGAZINE, Mary starts outfitting their apartment with items geared to the infirm; safety bars in the bathroom, oversized telephones, etc. She even buys separate beds for them. 

They eventually get into a fight over their new divergent paths and ADAM decides to move into his office; their grown children – Irene, James and artist Benjamin are upset and scheme about ways to reunite their parents. 

Adam and Mary spend a couple of months together and both strike up romantic relationships with others; MARY falls for PETER, the handsome guy from the gym; while ADAM gets seduced by a younger coworker, MAYA. 

Adam and Mary are finally brought together when Mary’s mother NORA faints in public; medics want to take her to a hospital but Nora refuses. Mary finds out that ADAM has known for five years that Nora has been dying of cancer; ADAM helps put Nora out of her misery by assisting her death. He has been keeping it secret to fulfill Nora’s request; Nora knew Mary would simply worry too much about her mother’s condition.  MARY is so upset at Adam for keeping it quiet she leaves him for good. 

Months later at Nora’s funeral ceremony; Mary and Adam reconcile.

In a 1995 TV interview, an old man, Joseph Weismann, tells his story. Suddenly, he falters. 'If someone one day dares to make a film about what happened to us...' 
He breaks off. Then, 'No, I doubt it. I doubt anyone will dare...' 
 
2009. We're making a film about the roundup of the Jews of Paris in July 1942. 
From the point of view of Joseph Weismann, who was ten years old at the time. All the characters in this film really existed. All the events really took place. 
 
Montmartre, Paris. June, 1942. A small community of East European Jews has found refuge in the shadows of the neighborhood’s windmills. This is where we meet Jo and his family: his mother, Sura (Emmanuelle Seigner), who dotes on her only son; his sisters Rachel, the rebel, and Charlotte, the artist; and his father, Schmuel (Gad Elmaleh), who makes a living painting, models of the Sacré-Coeur that hawkers sell to German soldiers. Jo's the leader of his little gang, made up of Simon, a classmate, and Nono, Simon's gap-toothed five-year-old brother. It's through their boyish eyes that we see events unfold, starting with the apartheid that bans Jews from parks, theatres, sports fields and even the wooden merry-go-rounds... 
 
Suddenly, the Roundup begins. The police. The buses. And the indoor cycle track, the Vélodrome d'Hiver, where the Germans and the Vichy government order 13,000 Jewish families to be heaped together. Captured in raids all over the city. Taken from hospitals and orphanages. Even so, René Bouquet and his fellow collaborators consider the Roundup a failure. Hundreds of French people have risked their own freedom to help and hide the Jews. Which explains why only half the Jews on the authorities' lists fell into their net on that fateful day. 
 
Simon and Nono lose their mother, Bella (Sylvie Testud), who dies of a miscarriage on arrival at the Vel d'Hiv. Another real-life character, Red Cross nurse Annette Monod (Mélanie Laurent) takes them under her wing. A young nursing school graduate, Annette is horrified to discover the reality of institutionalized racism and works all hours alongside one of the two Jewish doctors in the Vel d'Hiv, Dr. Sheinbaum (Jean Réno), in a losing battle to keep the detainees healthy. 
 
Annette's compassion leads her to ask to accompany the families to the Beaune la Rolande camp in the Loiret region, where over 7,000 Jewish families are interned prior to being sent to concentration camps in the East. Nobody has any inkling of their final destination. The families organize their lives in the camp and rediscover a glimmer of hope. Little Jo falls in love with an older girl, Renée, while savoring the cakes that nuns come to hand out from time to time. For the detainees are badly under-nourished. 
 
One morning, tragedy strikes. On the orders of the Germans, parents and children are separated. Jo and all the other children are left behind while their parents are marched off to the station. Jo decides to escape. With another boy, he wriggles under five meters of barbed wire. The next day, the remaining children are taken away; convinced they are being sent to join their parents in Poland. 
 
At the end of the war, Annette treats the survivors at the requisitioned Lutetia Hotel. She bumps into Jo, who has been adopted by a family in Le Mans after all his loved ones perished in the camps. She also meets up again with little Nono, whom his brother managed to push out of the moving train. While Annette hugs Nono, Jo walks away with his adopted family towards his new life... Towards the hope of a world where nothing like this will ever happen again.

COMMENTS
A family film for extremely young kids it seems; (perhaps 4 year olds would find it amusing) with none of the clever elements or strong story points that are usually peppered throughout the superior films of this genre in an attempt to keep parents from clawing their eyes out when their kids request to watch it.  The story seems predictable and also seems like a retread of a half dozen other Christmas movies, most similarly the Santa Clause. Piece of biz, if you’re looking for a French Animated version of the Santa Clause (thankfully, sans Tim Allen).

COMMENTS

Bangkok Dangerous is a serious and well written script with a main character whose skill and lack of empathy are intoxicating.  Joe is as cold blooded as they come, but over time his character starts to soften as he develops relationships with Kong and Fon.  He starts off the story cold, methodically going through his various routines but by the time he's decided to train Kong and date Fon, Joe begins to open up, showing an audience the human side of someone they otherwise might not get a chance to see.  His arc throughout the story is very subtle but the writer knows just when and where to affect the audience most.  By the time Joe pays his last visit to Fon you know he's never going to see her again - you're left crushed, knowing that she just may have been his salvation.  Along with a surprisingly strong character study the script is laden with style that'll easily resonate on screen.  Whether it's killing men with his high powered rifle, shooting them from a speeding motorcycle, or using a guy as a human shield with two high powered rifles resting on the guys shoulders, the things Joe does are just really really cool.  The story provides plenty of violence, sexy girls, and a dreadfully beautiful glimpse into the nightmarish world of contract killing.      

SUMMARY 

	JOE is a hit man, as professional as they come.  His first target is a snitch that is being held inside police headquarters.  With stunning precision Joe fires two shots, the first bullet crashing through glass and office walls, the second taking care of the snitch, hitting him right between the eyes.  Having laid out a water stained sweatshirt and running gear, Joe puts on his “disguise” and exits the building he fired the shot from, simply blending into a jogging group nearby.  After collecting payment – and killing the messenger who brought it, severing all ties between himself and the job – Joe flies to Bangkok.  He watches as KONG – a young thief – deftly relieve some tourists of their wallets and passports.  Liking his style, Joe gives him a job.  Kong’s first assignment is to pick up a briefcase from AOM, a stripper who works in BOSS SURAT’S club.  Joe has been given four high profile targets to take out and had needed supplies.  Kong brings back his equipment.  Having methodically studied target #1’s routine for days, Joe rides his motorcycle right up next to his motorcade and takes him out, slightly injuring himself as she speeds away.  Joe dresses the wound back at his condo while checking that payment for the job had been wire transferred into his account.  Still in pain Joe goes to a pharmacy where he meets a deaf Thai girl named FON.  He is immediately attracted to her.  
	Kong steals a necklace from a rich old couple then gives to Aom, who he’s had a crush on from the moment he met.  She’s impressed with his approach.  While delivering Joe’s case Kong gets jumped by street thugs.  They almost steal the case but Kong is able to escape.  He shows up at Joe’s and tells him what happened.  Not knowing if he can trust what Kong has said, Joe nearly kills him, not wanting to risk it.  But Kong begs Joe to teach him to properly defend himself.  In this moment something comes over Joe.  He decides to help this poor lost soul, teaching him what he knows.
	Joe kills target #2 by waiting for him under water.  The target goes for a swim and Joe holds him under water, waiting for him to draw his last breath.  Joe slips out of the compound the same way he entered, in the trunk of the maid’s car, unbeknownst to her or the compound’s guards.  Joe goes back to Fon’s store.  They flirt with each other then Joe takes her to dinner.  They’re clicking with one another.  Joe feels at ease with her.  
	Target #3 doesn’t go down easy.  Joe almost blows the job after he’s accidentally spotted but he is able to recover and kill the guy.  While out on a date with Fon thieves try to mug Joe.  They have weapons and he is forced to kill them.  Fon is so horrified by how controlled Joe is with handling them that she runs away from him.  Joe wants to explain but is unable to.  He loses himself in the tracking of the next target, Bangkok’s Prime Minister.  The job is high risk and dangerous and wanting to rid himself of all connections to it, Boss Surat decides to have Kong, Aom, and Joe all killed after it’s done… But Joe can't bring himself to kill the man, who is his people’s John F. Kennedy.  Police snipers spot Joe as he is packing up his equipment.  They open fire but Joe is able to escape, putting on another disguise and blending into the crowd.  Boss Surat’s men are waiting for him at the condo.  Surat found out where he lives after torturing Kong and Aom.  But Joe is ready for anything.  His place is booby trapped, wired to kill all the thugs that await him.  Joe pays one last visit to Fon to say goodbye.  They both know they’ll never have a future together.  Joe then shoots his way into Surat’s temple, finds Kong and Aom and sets them free.  Joe just has one target left: Surat.  He finds him about to flee the compound in a motorcade.  Police have arrived on the scene.  Joe is able to shoot his way into Boss Surat’s car, but he is surrounded by cops.  Kong is able to steal a police cruiser.  He speeds right at Boss Surat’s car.  Joe runs at the approaching car full speed and shoots out its windshield and jumps into it.  Kong the runs down Surat with the car and they’re able to escape.  Kong gets Joe a passport and safe passage on his brother’s trash trawler.  Joe gives him the number to a bank account in Switzerland filled with cash.  “Don’t spend it all in one place,” Joe tells him.

COMMENTS:
Project is still out to director and cast, and is also going through a script polish.  As it stands, it’s a pretty strong action piece with a plot that reminds me quite a bit of STOPPING POWER or CELLULAR, one of those popcorn movies where the hero is forced to perform extreme actions in the name of saving his family.  The script’s strengths are the sheer number of action sequences; the dialog and plotting isnt’ particularly clever or well done.  Still too early on this project. If new draft is stronger and big name lead is attached it could be worthwhile for popcorn only.


SUMMARY: 
NYC.  A cab picks up a mysterious passenger KIEFER; and the passenger kills the driver and assumes control of the cab. 

Legendary jewel thief MONTGOMERY gets released from prison after ten years.  His longtime nemesis; FBI agent HARLAN gives him a ride back into the city, inquiring about a supposed ten million dollars that MONTGOMERY has squirreled away somewhere in the city. 

MONTGOMERY’s first stop in the city is his 14 year old daughter’s house.  The young girl is living in the lap of luxury with her aunt and uncle.  He tries to reconcile with her but she is not interested.  ALLISON storms out of the apartment and gets into a taxi cab, unwittingly hopping into the cab driven by KIEFER, who has been hired to kidnap her. 

MONTGOMERY’s old partner JONAH threatens to have KIEFER kills ALLISON unless MONTGOMERY gives him the ten million dollars in stashed loot.   MONTGOMERY ask JONAH for more time to get the money, claiming that its upstate.  

MONTGOMERY turns to HARLAN for help, telling him that there is no money and that he needs help saving Allison’s life.  Harlan refuses to help and is skeptical of Montgomery’s story, insisting that for one; Jonah is dead.   Harlan puts FBI men on Montgomery’s tail. “This guy’s plotting something and I want to know what it is.” 

ALISON, bound and gagged in the trunk of the cab nearly escapes when KIEFER is forced to pick up a passenger, but the opportunity slips away and her life hangs in the balance. 

MONTGOMERY manages to find the address of an old accompliss of his, whom he believes may be able to lead him to JONAH.  MONTGOMERY ditches his tailing FBI agents, and accosts MERCER, but MERCER is no help, stalling for long enough for an FBI attack squad Montgomery.  Montgomery only narrowly escapes, but JONAH is beginning to become suspicious and threatens to kill Alison. 

MONTGOMERY steals a cab and heads to the cabbie headquarters, enlisting the dispatcher’s help to find KIEFER’s cab which is somewhere in Chinatown.  With the feds on his tail, Montgomery drives his stolen cab to Chinatown. 

Montgomery finds the cab with the right medallion number, but its being driven by a punk teenager who insists that “some guy paid me to drive the cab around all day!” KIEFER has taken Alison and switched cabs. 

HARLAN and the feds are investigating Montgomery’s story and HARLAN begins to realize that maybe the crook is telling the truth; he thinks that Montgomery actually doesn’t have the ten million; that he’s put it all into the purchase and decoration of Alison’s penthouse apartment. 

Realizing he’s out of time, Montgomery decides the only way to save his daughter is to rob a bank to get the money. Montgomery enlists the help of his old accomplice.  RILEY and the two break into the Bank of New York (the very same bank he got arrested trying to rob ten years prior).  RILEY turns out to be in cahoots with JONAH.  Once MONTGOMERY breaks into the vault and steals 20M she turns a gun on him.  HARLAN and the feds, meanwhile, play a hunch that Montgomery will rob a bank, and they too head for the Bank of New York. 

Harlan realizes his hunch was right and the bank is being robbed.  He pulls an alarm, which is just enough of a distraction for MONTGOMERY to kill RILEY and escape. MONTGOMERY finds KIEFER, JONAH and Alison in an abandoned wearhouse, kills the bad guys, and saves his daughter.

Two female vampires in modern-day New York City are faced with daunting romantic possibilities.

COMMENTS
Script is clever, mildly amusing but for me, overall silly. No idea what the budget of this will be or who else is going to star however it is going to be tricky to pull this off effectively, even for someone like Heckerling.  Script for me was quite silly despite certain clever elements - a support group of non-human blood drinkers where the 'good vampire' share their fears and desires, hypnosis to stop their enemies, STACY, the 'new' vampire of only 20-some years who still acts like a college student (which she is), etc.

The fact that this is somewhat of a rom com AND a vampire story is the weak link for me.  Ultimately the two vampires agree to abandon their nocturnal lives in order to be mortal again so STACY and her boyfriend JOEY VAN HELSING can be parents to their baby that STACY is carrying.  They of course enlist the help of JOEY's dad, DR VAN HELSING, to rid them of the nasty CISSERUS, so they can be human again - once a stem dies, the offshoots age to where they should be.

There are a few laughs as the amateur female vampires try to dispose of bodies for CISSERUS (she actually gets all of the best lines), but nothing really groundbreaking.

This is just not my type of material to begin with but seems as though it is going to be completely execution dependent.  I am skeptical about both producers, whom I know, and would not recommend this as a pre-buy, particularly without hearing more about casting choices.  If done 'properly' this could be a cult-y comedy.  If Heckerling does not hit it right, it is going to resemble a bad 80s comedy that will likely go straight to video.  Curious to hear what the budget is as well.

SUMMARY
Two 20-something, hip and non-human- eating female vampires, GOODY and STACY, struggle through present day life while their 'stem' CISSERUS, a diabolical she-vampire who created them, constantly asks them to clean up the path of destruction that she leaves in her wake.  The two want to live the simplest lives they can, having fun and eating only small animals.  They are forced to choose between life eternal and aging to their actual ages once they find out that STACY is pregnant, not to mention in love with the baby daddy.

COMMENTS
THE GIRL is a well-written and affecting drama however extremely arthouse. Emily Blunt in the lead role is a wonderful choice and gives the film a bit more international appeal but subject matter keeps this film smaller in scope.  This deals with US-Mexico immigration issues - seems that subject matter is serious situation in most countries but following on the heels of FROZEN RIVER a couple of years back, I am not sure where this film sits, even though that film dealt with US-Canada.

Story is well-told and once we realize the severity of the situation that Blunt’s character ASHLEY has gotten herself into, her path to redemption is an interesting one.  She realizes that since she did not do a good job with her own son and loses him to a foster family, she owes it to a girl that has essentially become orphaned because of Ashley's inexperience and stupidity, to get her back to her family.

I recommend the story and find it to be a tragic but probably all-too-true situation, yet a tough subject matter.  I don't think this is necessarily a pre-buy even for arthouse, unless anyone is confident that audiences will see just about anything with Emily Blunt.  Director is talented but has not made a feature since his LA CIUDAD in 1998.  He was the writer on SLEEP DEALER.  One to track for sure as I have no doubt this will be powerful, in the same vein as SIN NOMBRE.

SUMMARY
Emily Blunt's character ASHLEY is a down-on-her luck mother living in Texas who we learn got arrested for driving drunk with her young son in the car.  He was taken away from her and is now in foster care and she is desperate to get him back, but can't seem to get out of her own way and get her life together.  Her dad lives across the border in Mexico - he and Ashley spend a drunken night together and she accidentally learns that he is helping Mexicans across the border and making a lot of cash.  When all hope is lost and Ashley realizes she too needs to make some fast cash to get her son back (so she thinks), she decides to try to help a group cross into the US as well.  She is totally unprepared and thinks they can just cross a river on their own and she'll get them on the other side.  What happens is that a girl and her mother become separated, the girl looks to Ashley to help her find the mother, Ashley does not want to accept responsibility then finds out after going to the police and then the hospital that the mother has drowned and the girl is on her own.  Ashley finally accepts the severity of what she's caused due to her stupidity, and takes the girl all the way back to Oaxaca to be reunited with the rest of her family.

LOGLINE

Based on a true story about an IRA member who works as a “tout,” an informant to the British secret service, betraying his friends in an attempt to save innocent lives. 


COMMENTS

A very interesting story that is plagued by bad timing.  Three years ago, this story would have seemed quite fresh, but in light of the success of THE DEPARTED, its hard to think of it as anything but a retread.  There are several exciting sequences, though the inner workings of the IRA, THE CID, The British Soldiers and the MI5 are glossed over to the extent that the murky confusion seems accidental, rather than an implication of the situation.  Even structurally the story plays like a poor man’s version of Scorsese (see Departed, Goodfellas, Casino, etc).  Good direction could turn this into something interesting, but the script isn’t unique enough to demand attention as a prebuy, and I found myself wishing that the conflict was examined with more expertise and insight.


SUMMARY

A grizzled, cynical Scotland Yard agent FERGUS whiles away the day playing video games and avoiding responsibility.  He is stirred to action when he hears that BRENDAN MCCAFFREY has been shot. “Six bullets, point blank range.  It’s a miracle he’s alive – so far.”

Flash Back – Belfast 1988.  Brendan is a small time hood, selling stolen goods for an Irish crime syndicate.  He has a crush on a young catholic girl named LARA, but she doesn’t approve of his lifestyle and keeps her distance from him.  Brendan’s best friend SEAN is also involved in crime, and is even more brash than Brendan. Sean steals a car, and gets the two boys caught by British police.  Sean escapes, but Brendan is taken into custody, where the CID (undercover cops attached to Scotland Yard) try to recruit him as a “tout,” an informant.  Brendan steadfastly refuses. 

Lara’s brother FRANKIE gets attacked by masked members of the IRA.  When Brendan comes to Ray’s rescue, the IRA volunteers take Brendan prisoner, beating him mercilessly until their leader MICKY tells them to stop.  Micky recruits Brendan to join Sean as the youngest members of the IRA.  Brendan agrees.

Fergus finds out that Brendan has been recruited by the IRA, and again tries to recruit Brendan to be a snitch, but Brendan says “if you wanna give me money and a car for nothing – that’s fine by me, but I’m never gonna be a tout.” 

Ray does his first job for the IRA, dropping off a dangerous looking man at a place in Lisbon.  Later that night he takes LARA out on a fancy date in a nearby neighborhood and is shocked to see that the mission to Lisbon resulted in a bombing that took several casualties. 

Brendan is so shaken up when he sees the victims that he decides to help Fergus.  During a mission where Sean and Brendan bring explosives to planned bombing sight, Brendan alerts Fergus and his career as an informant begins.  

Lara tells Brendan that she’s pregnant.  His mother overhears the conversation and is surprisingly supportive. “I guess there’s a congratulations in order.”  Lara’s conservative mother, on the other hand, throws Lara out of the house.  Brendan and Lara “shack up.” 

Brendan gets promoted to an intelligence position within the IRA.  Fergus is elated by the news, which means that Brendan will be capable of providing more and more important inside updates. Unfortunately, the IRA knows there’s a leak.  Sean, jealous of Brendan’s rapid rise within the ranks, seems to be suspicious of his best friend.  

MCINTY, an IRA volunteer specializing in torturing prisoners, captures  a YOUNG MAN, believed to be the tout.  “He’s the one told the peelers about Portsmouth!” Brendan is forced to shoot the tout in the head, in order to preserve his own anonymity.  He hesitates and tries to hand the gun off to Sean, but the gun goes off during the exchange, killing the innocent young man. “No more leak…” 

Brendan gets fully sworn in as a member of the IRA and paired with GRACE, an intelligence operative. The trouble for Brendan is that Grace, along with being a top target of the CID, is also incredibly hot and flirtatious.  “Darling, I’m not asking you to marry me, I just thought a drink at the pub would be fun.” 

Lara has the baby, but her elation is short lived.  She walks in on Brendan loading bomb making equipment into a hidden compartment in their closet. “You’ll end up either dead or in jail!” 

Micky (the IRA leader) is growing more and more fond of Brendan, and plans to use Sean and Brendan as leaders of an important mission.  Grace continues her flirtation with Brendan, taking him out for drinks and kissing him, but Brendan remains loyal to Lara. His loyalty does little to assuage her anger and fear; after he disappears for three days on a secret mission, Lara leaves him and moves in with her mother.

To win her back, Brendan buys a nice house, new furniture and TV which makes Sean even more suspicious.  The IRA plans a big bombing, hoping to kill a ton of prison guards known to congregate in a targeted pub.  Brendan alerts Fergus to the mission, but Fergus gets pulled off the case when the MI5 assumes jurisdiction over Brendan.  

On the day of the Mission, British soldiers swarm the pub, alerting the IRA that their mission has been compromised.  Sean and Grace know immediately that Brendan is the snitch. “You’re scum… you and your family are dead.” Brendan is captured by the IRA and taken to an apartment complex, his death imminent.  

Fergus, knowing that Brendan’s life is in danger, but is in no position to help, having been pulled off the case by the MI5.  Desperate, he calls in a bomb threat at the apartment building which causes British authorities to swarm the building.  During the confusion, Sean has a change of heart and decides to help Brendan escape.
 
Brendan and Fergus conspire to make it seem as if Brendan is dead.  Lara holds a funeral, unaware that Brendan is still alive and living under an assumed name in Scotland.

Years later, Brendan is shot six times by an IRA assassin, but manages to survive again. “I changed names and addresses six times in six months. I am still on the run.”

AN ex-con gets out of prison and takes a job driving a whore around NYC; and quickly finds himself caught up in a sex trafficking ring that specializes in adolescents. 
 
COMMENTS
Intensely dark story, pretty well written, but is going to be extremely unsettling; especially as Larry Clark has always tiptoed the line of poor taste when it comes to the subject of underage sex and nudity; leaving me to believe that a lot of this extremely graphic content will be, well, extremely graphic. Clark’s KEN PARK was banned in the US for the underage nudity; and this one has got controversy written all over it. The story itself isn’t fantastic; this isn’t a prebuy. 
 
SUMMARY
INTRO – GEORGE gets sent to prison and gets raped by his cellmate.  GEORGE exacts revenge by pouring burning water on the con’s face. 
 
SIMONE gets taken in by a pimp, ANDERSON, who brands her ass with a big “A.” SIMONE slips free of her shackles and stabs him in the eye with the heel of her stiletto. 
 
12 years later.  GEORGE gets out of jail and returns home to Greenepoint, Brooklyn, but his wife has taken up with a cop and his daughter doesn’t recognize him. GEORGE’s friend TOMMY lets him stay at his commercial garage and gives him back his old, vintage taxi cab; and tells him that the neighborhood has completely changed.  
 
GEORGE quickly gets in touch with MORTLOCK; a gangster who was involved with GEORGE getting locked up.  MORTLOCK gives George a job picking up Ecuadorian kids from the airport, and George gets pissed, livid that he’s being treated like a dog when he should be getting rewards for keeping his mouth shut for a decade. 
 
GEORGE gets a job as SIMONE’s driver, taking the whore from John to John all throughout NYC. 
 
SIMONE tells GEORGE a horror story about a young girl who’s been trapped by her former PIMPS and asks GEORGE to help her free the girl.  In the meantime, MORTLOCK tells GEORGE to get evidence of one of SIMONE’S johns, “THE ARAB,” doing kinky and embarrassing things. 
 
GEORGE goes to a house in suburban New Jersey where MORTLOCK, ANDERSON and others are holding young kids as sex slaves. One of them knows MAY, the girl SIMONE is looking for. 
 
GEORGE finds MAY and rescues her from the house, running off with MAY and SIMONE to Niagara Falls, but he realizes that SIMONE is only using him.  She’s a lesbian, in love with MAY.  ANDERSON and MORTLOCK catch them and they all get in a gun fight, SIMONE winds up shooting and killing MORTLOCK and ANDERSON.  GEORGE escapes, heartbroken and alone.

A hard boiled private detective is brought in by the cops who want him to explain why  there’s a trail of dead bodies that all seem to revolve around him. 

COMMENTS:
This script has a snarky tone and a fast paced; faux hip style that reminds me of the slew of knockoff “Tarantinoesque” movies from the late nineties. Director is a longtime producer who’s not really a known commodity as a director and the script is lampooning the crime genre in a way that doesn’t feel particularly fresh.  The pseudo hard boiled dialog consistently falls flat. Pass. 


SUMMARY:
Surly private detective CRUZ gets interrogated by three police detectives; “you’ve left quite a trail; five dead.  They force him to tell the story that led to his abduction.  He tells them he was looking for a girl. 

FLASHBACK – CRUZ is fed up with being a private detective; and is ready to quit when a giant boxer named ANTON “THE PRO” PROTOPOPOV walks into his office, desperate for CRUZ to find his girlfriend LEXI.  The problem is, ANTON has never really met her in person, she was his prison pen al.  He wants to find her desperately.  

The investigation takes Cruz all around LA; from porn sets to strip clubs to hospitals and jazz bars; and he consistently reaches dead ends; but more mysteriously, each person he interviews winds up getting brutally killed. Cruz suspects that someone is chasing ANTON because of his knowledge of the whereabouts of $30M in diamonds.  The investigation leads him to SAN CELERITAS, NEW MEXICO; the birthplace of the atom bomb.  At a café he meets FAY, a waitress with a keen interest in the Big Bang.  Like everyone else he’s run across over the course of his investigation, Fay has never heard of Lexi, but she tells him about a man, SIMON, who has built a device that will lead to the infamous GOD PARTICLE< the source of life in the universe.  The cops have no interest in the origin of life; by now, Cruz has figured out that they want the diamonds.  Only Cruz can lead them to the stash, and only if he can find Lexi Persimmon. 

The deeper Cruz’s investigation gets, the more obsessed he becomes with Lexi, and the closer he gets to the truth about her, the more confused he becomes.  The cop’s interrogation becomes more relentless as Kestral comes closer to setting off his massive collider.  When Cruz goes to dinner at Kestral’s house and meets his wife JULIE, everything clicks into place and he understands that like Anton; he’s chasing someone who doesn’t exist except for in his imagination; and he realizes the diamonds are hidden in plain sight.

Follows the rise and fall of notorious American lobbyist JACK ABRAMOFF, whose fall from power was a national disgrace. 

COMMENTS:
Pretty good script, but very American, insidery, and doesn’t have an edge or a hook that I think will give it an international appeal. Abramoff is a notorious character in American political circles, but is he internationally known?  Hickenlooper’s last film, FACTORY GIRL was pretty weak as well.  I don’t think it’s a prebuy; and reading some of the other scripts for Cannes there are a lot about very similar topics (namely, American Corruption in politics and business, etc) and this one doesn’t really stand out.  

SUMMARY:
2005 JACK ABRAMOFF, a smooth talking, good looking lobbyist gets a phone call from a reporter who tells him that she’s breaking a story about his illegal deal making within Washington.  Abramoff declines to comment and attempts to flee town, but gets arrested moments before boarding a private jet. 

FOUR YEARS EARLIER – January 2001 

GEORGE BUSH takes office and JACK is on the top of the world; JACK and his protégée SCANLON have connections to many of the top republican officials who are now taking offices of power; particularly Senator TOM DELAY from Texas, and BOB NEY a congressman from Ohio.  “Nothing is more important than access; in Washington it’s the air you breathe.” 

JACK and SCANLON wine and dine a chief of an Indian tribe; taking CHIEF PONCHO of the Chippewas to Scotland to play at St. Andrews golf course.  The chief is reluctant to hire them; “it’s a fuck of a large fee,” but Jack is very convincing and warns him that without his influence, a neighboring tribe is going to open a casino that will cut into the Chippewa’s profits. 

Jack’s boss insists that Jack take on a client in Florida; a Greek off-shore casino owner, GUS BOULIS.  The Feds are forcing Gus to sell his profitable casino; muscling him with hundreds of thousands of dollars in fines and threatening to revoke his gambling license.  JACK and SCANLON hatch a plan; they will buy the casinos themselves. It’s a highly illegal (not to mention unethical) plan in which they embezzle money from the Chippewas to pay for the casinos, using a front man; ADAM KIDAN; a sketchy businessman (“leave the last s off for savings!” ) with ties to the mob. A terrible choice that prophets doom for Abramoff. 

Their plan meets a roadblock when they find out PONCHO is answerable to a Chippewa tribal board.  Scanlon muscles a descenting vote, ED SPRAGUE, off the board; effectively ruining the man’s life and creating a devoted enemy in the process. 

When BOULIS balks at Abramoff’s deal; JACK cashes in a favor and gets his friends in congress to add heat to BOULIS; making national news questioning the validity of the gambling company. 

Jack gets fired from his agency for shady dealings with the Suncruz casinos. (“I’m shit canning you myself!”) Jack takes his clients to a rival firm; the law firm GREENBURG TRAURIG. 

After being named a “superlobbyist” in a national publication, Jack starts suffering from “delusions of grandeur”, opening a school he thinks will grow to be a highly respected academy despite the fact that its in a strip mall; and hiring a French chef to headline Jack’s new restaurant (“liberal portions with conservative prices”).

KIDAN and BOULIS almost immediately clash, mainly over Kidan’s assertion that Boulis should fire some of his family members who make up the majority of the casino’s staff; BOULIS attacks KIDAN, nearly killing him with a bic pen.  Jack smoothes things over with BOULIS by promising him a ton of money and future casinos, but KIDAN hires a hit man to kill BOULIS… creating a trail that leads directly to JACK’s implication in the scandal, not to mention the murder. 

SCANLON cheats on his girlfriend and she reports all of his and Jack’s illegal dealings to the feds. The Washington Post talks to ED SPRAGUE (the wronged Chippewa tribal leader) who tells them about Abramoff’s illegal dealings. 

When the shit hits the fan, Jack’s “friends” instantly distance themselves from him and Scanlon turns on him, serving up records of Jack’s tradings in order to secure his own freedom.  Jack is finished. He tries to flee but gets caught by the FBI. 

Jack gets sentenced to prison and forced to repay all the money to the Chippewas, as well as 1.7M to the IRS.

LOGLINE 

When Fiona begins to show clear signs of early onset Alzheimer’s her husband of fifty years is faced with the terrible proposition of putting his wife in a home.

SUMMARY

FIONA has always been a little flakey.   She once left a fur in storage and forgot to pick it up, and is constantly misplacing or forgetting things.  Recently, her husband GRANT has noticed that these symptoms are getting worse and worse.  She is forgetting words, leaving the burners on the stove, and beginning to endanger herself by wandering off aimlessly and forgetting the way back home.

Grant is really troubled, and tries to deny her condition.   Fiona, in her lucid moments, realizes that going into a home is the best solution for both of them.  Fiona is frank and forthright, and doesn’t even tour MEADOWLAKE HOME before agreeing to move there.   Grant goes on the tour and is shocked to see the second floor, where the patients with severe Alzheimer’s live. He insists that Fiona will never have to live on the second floor.  He also greatly dislikes the head administrative nurse giving him a tour, MADELEINE, a tough insensitive woman reminiscent of Nurse Ratchet.  Meadowlakes has a rule that makes Grant very uncomfortable; the patient must not see any loved ones for the first thirty days of their stay.   Fiona isn’t troubled by any these developments and insists on going.

When they make it to the hospital, Grant becomes even more hesitant and emotional, but Fiona reassures him that she will be all right.  She has sex with him on her new bed and pleads with him to leave her.

COMMENTS

The script is touching and funny at times, and the scene where Grant leaves his wife at the nursing home is genuinely heart-wrenching.  Polley’s script is good for a first time writer.  The two main characters are nicely created, deep, full characters, whose troubling emotions are well depicted.  I am not sure how well a wide audience will accept a film with such a depressing topic.  Alzheimer’s is a painful and depressing topic.  Perhaps a film to keep our eyes on – the casting of the male lead and Polley’s direction will be very important – but I can’t recommend as a prebuy.

LOGLINE

On November 19th 2005 in Iraq, an Insurgent attack on an American Convoy of US Marines resulted in the death of a Marine. In an attempt to counter this attack the US house searches lead to a further twenty-four people being killed many of whom were women and children - casualties of a war they could not control. The marines too were victims, having been attacked and having to respond in the way that they were trained. 


COMMENTS

This is more of a long treatment than a screenplay, with the dialog to be improvised on set. Broomfield is sure to provide a humanistic perspective to the project, and the treatment outlines an interesting pastiche of characters while demonizing the US military authority, & the story is indeed tragic, but it blends in with the glut of films about Iraq that are coming out, and is definitely not a prebuy. 

SUMMARY

The Marines from Kilo Company return to the US, and PVT Ramirez, who is likely suffering from PTSD (post traumatic stress disorder) suffers a flashback, steals a car and crashes into a house.

FLASHBACK – November 2005, Iraq

The USMA’s collective confidence was soaring after Marines had killed over a thousand insurgents in Fallujah, and blasted their way forward into Haditha, but after fifty marines were ambushed and killed, the marines realizes that the insurgents had adapted and were now fighting a guerrilla war.  

While the Marines train extensively, learning “house clearing” techniques and other methods of warfar, AHMAL and JAFAR, two Iraqis, prepare an IED attack. Young SABA, an Iraqi villager, sees the two men preparing to plant the IED in the road, but is unsure what to do, knowing that if her male relatives will become suspects no matter what she chooses to do.  

RASHIED and HIBA, a young Iraqi family, realize that they are doomed if they remain in Haditha, because they are a Shiite and a Sunni, they plan to flee to Jordan.

Innocent lives are constantly in jeopardy in Haditha, a US war drone kills a young man “of military age” who was simply planting an olive tree. 

Ahmal and Jafar blow up a humvee and kill us Marine TJ, a good buddy of Ramirez’s.  Rashiel and Hiba pray that no one was killed in the attack, realizing that they’ll all be held responsible.  

Ramirez and fellow Marine Mason are livid “let’s find the motherfuckers who did this.”  Mason executes four innocent travelers and the Marines begin invading houses, “clearing” them by throwing in grenades and killing any survivors.

Rashied runs into the fray to search for Hiba and is killed.  Saba’s entire family is killed.  

Ahmal, looking at all the bloodshed, feels remorseful for his attack.  

6 months later¬ 

Four Marines are arrested and held responsible for the murder of innocent civilians.  Hiba now a widower, has a child.  Ramirez goes to jail for car theft.

SUMMARY:  

22-Year Jane Austen is in a spot of trouble.  Jane’s older sister is happily married leaving Jane’s parents with the small but pressing problem of finding her a husband.  The family is big in size and small on cash.  So when pompous Mr. Wisely, the only relative to the wealthy and important Lady Gresham, offers his hand, everyone is delighted.  Everyone that is apart from Jane, who loves literature, life and above all believes in happy endings.

Tom Lefroy is also in trouble.  He has enjoyed London for all its worth – a charming rogue who instead of studying law spends his time boxing, drinking and womanizing.  Now he has to answer for these crimes of pleasure to his uptight uncle, Judge Langlois.  The punishment?  Spending the summer with his boring relatives in Hampshire, thus being cut off from his inheritance.

The English countryside may seem peaceful on the surface, but the summer parties are decadent and at one of these celebrations, Tom and Jane meet.  A game of cat and mouse ensues, sparks fly and over the summer they fall in love.  

However, with Tom’s reputations and Jane’s family saga, the affair can have only one outcome.  But this is Jane Austen and there’s always got to be room for a happy ending.

COMMENTS:

This is a well-crafted period romance that follows the same dramatic formula as Shakespeare in Love: The author is placed within the same narrative framework as their own work (In this case, Jane Austen lives her own version of Pride and Prejudice).  Since the plotting is socially motivated, the script refreshingly takes its time to properly establish its characters and their needs.  Jane is charming because of her sharp wit and her modern defiance of class and money over happiness.  Tom is a scoundrel, but through his interaction with Jane he reforms himself into a likeable character.  In the end, when Jane and Tom sacrifice their relationship for the greater good, it makes for a genuinely touching moment between two people who realize that they can’t run off to happiness at the expense of their family’s suffering.  However, amidst these positives, there are some concerns.  Jane Austen adaptations play to a limited female demographic, and with the upcoming Pride and Prejudice being released for awards season, there is a risk that by the time Becoming Jane hits theaters, audiences may have lost their taste for potentially over-tilled material.  Subsequently, this is a consider with reservations.

DIRECTOR:  Scott Hicks
WRITER: Alan Cubitt
CAST: Clive Owen
STATUS: Preproduction
GENRE: Drama
READER: Steven Murphy

LOGLINE

Based on the memoirs of Simon Carr who lost his wife to cancer, and now has to raise two boys on his own.

COMMENTS

Not a particularly cinematic story, the charm and humor of the memoir breaks the surface on a few occasions, but I found myself wishing that I was reading the book rather than the adapted screenplay.  Clive Owens wooden charm might work well in this weepy part, but I agree that its not a prebuy.

MW – comments – Overwritten, not a prebuy at this stage.  Need to see something. A family drama that needs more edge.  


SUMMARY

JOE, a sports reporter based in Australia copes with raising his rambunctious son ARTIE alone, after the tragic death of KATY of cancer.  Shortly after Artie’s birth, Katy doubled over in pain.  During the ensuing months, as the sickness quickly spread through her body, Joe struggles to play nurse while caring for the young child, who seems strangely affected by his mother’s sickness, and by learning so much about death at such a young age. “Don’t worry daddy, I’ll stay down here with you for now.” 

After Katy’s death, Joe plans to travel with Artie.  Katy’s mother Barbara is nonplussed by the idea, accusing Joe of running away from his life and not dealing with his problems.  Joe, who has spent much of Artie’s life traveling for work feels as if he and his son are “intimate strangers” and decides to curry his son’s favor by hardly imposing any rules at all.  Joe has visions of Katy standing by his side, giving him parenting advice which he mostly ignores.  “Tell him no.  Tell him no.” 

Barbara offers to watch Artie, but Joe turns down her help, getting a hand instead from the attractive LAURA, a fellow single parent whom he meets at Artie’s new school.  Their friendship quickly develops,   “I could fall madly in bed with you,” but the young widower is slow to act on his feelings.

Joe gets a troubled phone call from his first wife FLICK.  She nearly begs him to take their son HARRY for the summer, citing some strange, vague problems.  Hesistant at first, Joe caves.  Harry, a bitter, troubled British youth shows up in Australia, hesistant to open up to his father who abandoned him years ago.  

The three “men” live in “hog heaven,” tearing apart Joe’s nice home while barely adhering to the few rules that Joe tries to enact.  Facing threat of losing his job, Joe is forced to go to the Australian Open.  He tries to get Barbara and Laura to watch the kids, but his behavior over the past months has already alienated them to the point that they both refuse to help.  Joe leaves the boys alone.  

Enjoying his weekend of freedom, Joe gets drunk, loses his phone in a barfight, and has sex with a stranger.  When his phone is retrieved, he is horrified to find that there are fourteen missed calls from Harry, and even more shocked when he returns home to find cops in the house.  Local ruffians, upon finding out that Artie and Harry were unsupervised, threw an impromptu party with “alcohol, drugs and underage sex.” Harry was sent home to London and Artie was put into Barbara’s custody.  

Joe, bruised and desperate, manages to retrieve Artie from Barbara’s house.  He and Artie fly to London and convince Harry to return to Australia to live with them.  Joe reconciles with Barbara and resumes his flirtation with Laura.

 A reimagining of the Cervantes Classic; follows a TV commercial director TOBY, who returns to a small Spanish village where he once filmed an artful version of Don Quixote, but he finds that his film changed the villagers lives; and largely for the worse. 
 
COMMENTS:
 Gilliam’s DR PARNASSUS was visually stunning but painful to watch because of a really poor, nonsensical script, and Gilliam seems to be falling into the same trap here. The overall conceit is gimmicky and Gilliams flights of whimsy and fancy are completely overwhelming. The adaptation is childish and confusing and I found myself wishing (over and over) that he’d just stuck to the source material. Frankly, I’m not sure he even read the source material.   I hate to be so critical of Gilliam, Brazil and Twelve Monkeys and Fisher King are all favorites of mine; but this is a big disappointment, and will likely fail satisfy the fans that have been yearning for this long awaited adaptation.  Pass. 
 
SUMMARY:
 TOBY directs a big budget, but soulless recreation of DON QUIXOTE; and he begins having second thoughts about the production, much to the chagrin of the producer. “It was your idea to come to Spain!!!” 
 
The BOSS of the advertising agency arrives; “here comes God…” and gives TOBY an old VHS, “for inspiration.” It’s a tape of Toby’s film he’d made years earlier in the same village.  The BOSS asks Toby to keep an eye on the boss’s girlfriend, JACQUI; but Toby and Jacqui take the opportunity as an excuse to fool around and nearly get caught by the Boss. Toby covers up by lying and saying a local gypsy had robbed her; framing the innocent man who winds up getting arrested. 
 
Toby visits the actual tiny village he’d shot his earlier film in, catching up with RAUL, the local bar owner. Raul tells him that the man who played Sancho Panza has died. “Many things change since you make your film Toby.  The dream, they crash.” A local BRUTE storms in and accuses Toby of “breaking” his little girl, whom he claims is no a whore. “Angelica wanted to be a big movie star.” 
 
Toby finds the peasant who played Don Quixote, but the man seems to have lost his mind, and still believes that he is the character.  Quixote mistakes Toby for Sancho Panza. “You have returned!”  Quixote lives in a weird wagon, seemingly being kept prisoner. Toby accidentally sets the wagon on fire; burning it down.  Toby speeds away as Quixote and his captor struggle and fight. 
 
Back on set the BOSS tells him that the police need to speak to him about the robbery.  The cops also question him about the fire in the wagon. Toby again blames the innocent gypsy. “I think you have gotten me into big trouble senor.”  Quixote, on his old nag, ROSINANTE, tries to fight the cops and free “sancho.”  The gypsy joins the melee, and Toby is forced to run off with Quixote; as a fugitive. 
 
Quixote attacks a wind mill, believing it’s a giant and winds up getting knocked on his rear and injured. A young girl promises to help them and leads them to a farm. Toby fears that they are prisoners of muslim extremists; but he also seemingly starts to hallucinate that they’ve gone back in time.  The farmer talks of the “inquisition” and a Holy Brotherhood on patrol.   After a wild skirmish involving the “monks,” the farmer and don Quixote, Toby wakes up… confused, and seemingly back in modern day. 
 
He finds Quixote talking to a group of men about his exploits.   The two hit the road; traipsing through the Spanish countryside together; when TOBY falls through a hole into a cavern.  In the cavern he finds ANGELICA; once she was a beautiful 13 year old girl who stared in Toby’s film, now she’s a bruised and hardened whore who belongs to a gangster. She blames Toby for her fate.  “You made me a promise.”  
 
Back on their trek; Quixote and Toby encounter THE KNIGHT OF THE MIRRORS. He challenges Quixote and the aging, (crazy) Knight battles him; defeating the knight. The Knight turns out to be Raul; he’d been trying to defeat the crazy Quixote to bring him back to reality. “this is your fault, you’re the one who made him crazy! You and your film destroyed good people!” 
 
Reality and the hallucination inspired dream world start to overtake TOBY until he can no longer really discern what is real and what is imagination. 
 
They see a caravan, with JACQUI; whom Quixote mistakes for royalty. 
 
Quixote finds himself the center of attention at a cast/crew dinner. TOBY is incredibly uncomfortable; especially because the producer and BOSS seem to be playing a massive joke on Quixote, at the old man’s expense. Toby tries to stop it, but its too late. Quixote gets humiliated. 
 
TOBY tries to free Angelica from her pimp/captor ALEXEI. Toby and Angelica kiss passionately.  Toby’s plan comes to an abrupt end; ALEXEI catches her.   Quixote admits he is nothing more than a cobbler.  Toby runs in search of Angelica; QUIXOTE joins the fight but falls off a balustrade and dies. 
 
TOBY’s hallucinations overcome him; he tries to protect Angelica from three “giants,” (Alexei, the Boss and Jacqui) and winds up attacking a windmill… we see him years later; older, crazed… and believing that he is now Don Quixote.

COMMENTS 
The script is fairly strong, but I was consistently irked by how dumb the main character was portrayed.  I don’t know the director’s work either; at best this could play like a rural “Cooler” with a strong cast and a relatively thrilling and violent plot, but it didn’t feel spectacular to me, and I had trouble picturing Fassbender making this role compelling. Good smaller parts for Church and Macy.   Worth a look, but would say wait to see the film if possible.  More for arthouse than popcorn. 

SYNOPSIS
JOHN, a hunter, stalks a deer. He fires his shot gun and accidentally kills a teen girl.  While riffling through her stuff in an attempt to find identification he discovers a bag stuffed with a ton of money.  He hides the girls body in a cavern where she seemed to have hung out; the cavern was filled with a sleeping bag, condoms, cigarettes, etc. 

JOHN returns to town guilt ridden and jumpy.  His wife has left him and he’s clearly been broke for a long time.  He gives her the money and hopes she will come back to him, but the money scares her and she fears that he’s involved in something dangerous. 

JOHN starts being suspicious of everyone in town, notably his friend SIMON and a drifter named CORNISH. 

His alarm is justified when a mysterious shooter kills John’s dog. John gets an anonymous warning to return the money. 

John’s panic increases when the Dead Girl’s body appears, wrapped in plastic, on his bed with a note that reads “John Moon Killed me.”  

John realizes that CORNISH is trying to get the money back; and local lawyer PITT is also involved.  WAYLON, the dead girl’s much older lover, is the man the money belonged to, and John witnesses Waylon brutally kill Cornish.  John fears that his wife MOIRA and his son are in danger.  He threatens PITT to give him their whereabouts and bursts in to a lakeside cabin, only to find Moira having sex with one of John’s old bosses. 

John buries the money in a tree and digs a grave for the dead girl. While burying it he runs into a farm girl, ABBIE (her father owns a farm John’s father used to own).  ABBIE invites herself over to John’s trailer to make him lunch. Waylon bursts in and takes her hostage, threatening to kill her if John doesn’t give him the money. 

John takes them to the woods and manages to shoot Waylon with a rifle; Waylon is still barely alive and stabs john with a knife. Abbie pulls the knife out and kills Waylon.  John tries to head into the woods to finish burying the dead girl, but passes out.

When he wakes up, his wife tells him that the cops think he is a hero; they never found the body.  John gets a letter from SIMON who tells him that he finished burying the body. “I aint no god, but I’m not so bad neither.”

I don't see a need to pre-buy this film at this point. It's what I call a 'loser' film. A nerd/unhappy always beaten down guy goes and does something even more stupid. He decides to become a super hero in a ridiculous outfit and starts smashing people with a lead pipe that he feels are 'bad’. What is the fun in seeing somebody die on stage? I hate movies like that. It is just sad and depressing, not funny. Way too simple for arthouse. Not funny enough to be breakout silly comedy. The script tries to be uplifting in the end, but it didn't work for me. The set up took so long and was so sad, that the writer lost me. I think the same will happen with audiences. None of the characters has a quality that could uplift me. I still felt sad and depressed at the end of the script.

The plot must seem absurd when one reviews the coverage; but its’ actually engaging and moves quickly.  There are definitely weaknesses to the script, notably some really clunky dialog passages, particularly the outbursts from BETSY, and some heavy handed character development (betsy’s ptsd) and head scratching problems with the story (why did theroux hire someone with problems of mental history / why did the writers choose to resolve it all w flashback)… but in spite of being incredibly rough around the edges; the zombie plantation & possessed kids manage to make this an enjoyable horror film. It’s a piece of business that will work if the genre plays (only for middle east).  It’s not a big theatrical movie, more like TV video value for other territories; but it’s gripping and has a several scares peppered in throughout. No attachment info, but a hot lead actress would help. 
 
SUMMARY 
 
A woman, terrified, runs through a field, pursued by scaring DARK FIGURES. She screams as they close in on her. 
 
BETSY is a beloved teacher at a high school; but is traumatized when a troubled student DEREK opens fire in her classroom, killing SUSAN and badly injuring BETSY. Betsy is haunted by visions of the deceased kids and forced to quit teaching; she breaks up with her fiancée and takes a private teaching job in New Orleans, but is still haunted by visions of Derek. 
 
BETSY gets a job that seems too good to be true; as the overpaid private teacher for a pair of precious children on shipping millionaire THEROUX’s remote Plantation. The catch? Theroux does not allow any “distractions” at the plantation, including NO internet, TV, radio or media outlets of any sort. 
 
The children, MILES and AMANDA, live under Theroux’s strict rules because their mother is sick and quarantined alone in the third floor of the house; they have no access to her and it’s as if she’s dead… BETSY takes pity on them and forgives their unruliness, even realizing that they’ve invented an imaginary friend, JOSHUA, whom Betsy believes is a manifestation of their grief.  When Betsy mentions the name JOSHUA to THEROUX he explodes at her. 
 
BETSY grows closer to the kids and begins enjoying her job; but Theroux still looms as a demanding, perhaps abusive presence. 
 
BETSY is spooked when she thinks she hears MILES upstairs; she gets reprimanded by the house servant ALMA for going up to the third floor; the following day something falls off the roof and nearly kills BETSY. “now Joshua is trying to hurt you too.” 
 
Theroux’s friendly driver LOUIS tells Betsy that Joshua was the oldest child; and that he’d “drowned in the swamp” and tells her that THEROUX may have been responsible for the boy’s death. BETSY confronts THEROUX, and he (seemingly?) explodes, yelling at his daughter AMANDA; and “firing” a gun at her… she falls to the floor, smoke rising from her hairline; but when BETSY looks again, AMANDA is gone.  Was Betsy hallucinating again? 
 
MRS RAND; who oversees the plantation, starts to grow weary of BETSY; claiming that her hire was a bad idea, and insisting that she’s hallucinating.    BETSY yells at her; establishing a tense rivalry between the pair.  BETSY seeks assistance from the quiet, reserved and timid ALMA, who is afraid to speak out against RAND or THEROUX, but cares deeply for the children. 
 
BETSY’s “hallucinations” get more severe, including visions of a bluebird and a shell with black hair inside; which Alma explains are symbols of voodoo magic. 
 
An agent from child protective services comes to the house and tells BETSY, in confidence, that he’s afraid for her safety and the safety of the children; he promises to return in a week. 
 
BETSY is alarmed to find out that LOUIS, the friendly driver, has vanished. “Louis will no longer be driving.” 
 
AMANDA has an outburst during class and tells BETSY that JOSHUA, “is not dead! Daddy says he is but he’s not!”  BETSY sees MILES heading off the property, into the forbidden woods; she follows, but is panicked when she sees DARK FIGURES with soulless eyes; and finds the dead body of LOUIS. She passes out, and wakes to find THEROUX and a doctor, who all insist she was hallucinating; the body was the body of a deer.  The DOCTOR puts BETSY back on medication.  
 
A different agent from Child protective services arrives and tells an alarmed Betsy that the previous agent has rapidly come down with cancer. Betsy fears that RAND poisoned the agent; but has no recourse. “They don’t think he’s gonna make it.” 
 
ALMA tells BETSY that THEROUX is a voodoo magic priest and that he killed his son JOSHUA on the boys’ tenth birthday in order to drain his power; Joshua lives on in a zombified, enslaved state. He plans to do the same to Amanda and Miles. Betsy plans to stop him. 
 
BETSY must help them escape, because he has trapped them inside with his powers; BETSY’s boyfriend arrives; he thinks that THEROUX is harmless and friendly, and that BETSY is truly losing her mind; but she manages to convince him when she reveals that the children’s feet have been branded. ROBERT rushes to the police but they turn on him and kill him. 
 
On the eve of the children’s birthday, a group of voodoo practicioners, including the doctor and the chief of police, arrive at the plantation.  ALMA tells BETSY that only “Mama Grand” can help; MAMA GRAND is a black voodoo priestess who lives on the plantation and helps BETSY see the spirits walking amongst them and shows BETSY visions of THEROUX’s murder of his own child. 
 
BETSY and ALMA fight back; RAND kills ALMA, but ALMA manages to break “Rand’s Charm” first, which helps free the voodoo enslaved, but also unleashes hordes of zombies. BETSY, MILES and AMANDA all run from the zombies, 
“they’re coming!!!” 
 
BETSY manages to steal a car from the garage and speeds off; THEROUX and the other voodoo members take chase; and THEROUX screams, pleading for BETSY to stop. “You don’t know what you’re unleashing!” 
 
We realize the TWINS are evil; Theroux has been trying to keep their voodoo evil contained; They are the ones who killed JOSHUA & MAMA GRAND is a voodoo priestess who has them under her spell.  In flashback, we also see that ALMA was evil; she poisoned the Child Protection Services Agent; she killed LOUIS…
 
BETSY tries to kill them by driving the car into the river; she dies in the process but the children survive… MAMA GRAND’s demon seed live on.

LOGLINE

A rickshaw puller takes a menial job at the Union Carbide plant in Bhopal, India where he witnesses the neglect for safety and human life at the plant leading up to the disastrous release of toxins on Dec. 3, 1984.


COMMENTS

Well done, but lacking the devastating punch that I expected from a piece like this.  The writer does a good job presenting the different characters evenly, but I was  surprised that the Carbide execs weren’t more vilified.  Anderson seemed to have almost humanitarian motives for opening a plant in India, and the safety oversights, though avoidable, did not seem as atrocious as it purely ignorant… I liked the script, but I never felt emotionally involved, never felt thrilled by the plot… this is a good script with something missing.  

SUMMARY 

The night of  DILIP’s sisters wedding, there is an emergency at the carbide plant and gas starts to leak.

In the Indian slum of Bhopal, locals look up to the carbide factory workers – the only men in town who make a decent living.  The rest of the villagers, peasants, merchants, criminals, complain about the smoke that emanates from the plant, but realize that without Carbide, Bhopal’s economy would collapse.

DILIP is a young man from a poor background.  He runs a rickshaw, but tries to make extra money by ripping off peasants, selling expired milk, fake mineral soda, etc.  He owes a local loanshark PASHA lots of money, and needs cash to feed his wife and child as well as save up for his sister’s dowry.   Dilip’s situation gets even more dire when his rickshaw is stolen.  

Dilip gets a job at the factory after a previous worker gets sick and dies.   Dilip is a safety monitor, in charge of making sure that water doesn’t leak into the tanks of pesticide – water would set off a destructive chemical reaction if it came into contact with the chemical MIC (the pesticide).

The corporation has taken lots of cost saving measures that are jeopardizing the safety of the workers and the townspeople.  ANDERSON, the boss from the US, takes those risks because the Indian plant is the only Carbide plant in the world that is losing money.  

A French reporter, EVA comes to Bhopal and accuses Anderson of putting the people at risk.  She collaborates with a local reporter, KESWANI, whose daily paper constantly attacks Carbide.  

The situation explodes – literally, the night of December 3, 1984, the very night that Dilip’s sister is to get married.  During the ceremony, a temporary worker accidentally pours tons of water into the MIC tank.  DEY, an intelligent safety inspector in the plant struggles to fight the disaster, but wounds up dying from the fumes.  Deadly fumes burst out of the vats of pesticide, killing thousands in the town, including DILIP, and most of his family.    

Anderson moves to the US to escape prosecution, and the victims families receive three hundred dollars per death as compensation.

LOGLINE: A Montana rancher builds a rocket in his barn, intent on launching it into space.

SUMMARY:  

CHARLES FARMER is not an ordinary Montana rancher.  In the Air Force, he almost made it to Astronaut training, but had to drop out when his father committed suicide, forcing him to come home and take care of the family farm.  However, this hasn’t stopped Farmer from pursuing his dream.  For the last 15 years he’s been building a homemade rocket ship in his barn, with every intention of sending it into space, much to the admiration of his children, Sunshine (4), Stanley (8) and Shepard (teens), and to the worry of his wife AUDIE.  Farmer’s plan seems in doubt though when he’s denied a $50,000 loan for fuel by ARNOLD, the town banker.  Arnold tells Farmer that he’s already half a million dollars in debt thanks to his space project, and that if he doesn’t come up with payments soon the bank will foreclose on his farm.  

Back at home, Audie’s father, HAL suffers a heart attack scare.  The mailman delivers an eviction notice.  Farmer drives to the bank and throws a brick through the window, saying they can have his home back brick by brick.  JUDGE MILLER orders Farmer start making payments to the bank, and that he be psychologically evaluated by NURSE GOODE, who thinks Farmer is crazy.  Despite the obstacles, Farmer refuses to quit.  He pulls all of his children out of school, saying that he’s going to launch his rocket in 30 days, and that they’re his new ground control team.  Audie is livid, saying the children can’t participate, but Farmer won’t budge.  

The FBI arrives at the Farmer’s house, led by agents KILLBOURNE and MATHIS.  They’re suspicious of his attempt to buy so much fuel, fearful that it’s part of some kind of terrorist plot.  The agents threaten to deport farm hand PEPE back to Mexico and tell Farmer that he can’t fly his rocket until they’ve made a full investigation, setting up surveillance around the farm.

Farmer meets with his lawyer, KEVIN MUNCHAK, trying to see what he can do to get the Feds off his back.  Kevin alerts the press, and a media circus descends on Farmer’s ranch.  Farmer makes his story public, trying to get popular support for his plight. 
Back in Washington, FAA head JACOBSON is infuriated by Farmer’s story.  He orders every available branch of the Federal government to help discredit farmer and stop his plan to launch.

Audie starts to worry when the press begins reporting that her family is a band of crazed cultists.  She’s further concerned when child welfare agent GRETCHYN BOYD tells her that unless she reigns in her husband, she might end up losing custody of her children.  Audie discovers that the Farm is about to be repossessed.  At dinner, she blows up at Farmer for keeping the foreclosure a secret, and that unless he stops his launch, she’ll take the kids and leave.  Farmer refuses, saying that this is something he has to do.  In the wake of the domestic argument, Hal tells Farmer that he thinks he’s a great father since he’s gotten all of his children to share a dream.  Soon after, Hal suffers a heart attack and dies.  The family mourns his loss.

Hall and Kevin attend a special government hearing to determine whether the launch is legal.  The CIA accused Farmer of building a giant weapon of mass destruction in his backyard.  Jacobson confronts Farmer in private, saying that the military will destroy his farm unless he cancels. Undeterred, Farmer gives an impassioned speech saying that he has every right to dream, and the Government can’t stop him. At the last minute, Audie and the children arrive to voice their support.  The committee says that they’ll make a ruling in 30 days.  Farmer says that he doesn’t have that much time.  

Late that night, Farmer tells Audie that he’s afraid of losing his dream the same way his father did.  The following morning, Audie is awaked by a tremendous boom from outside: Farmer is launching the rocket early!  Mid launch, the rocket tips over.  It crashes through the cow fields, nearly killing Farmer.  Audie and the family rush him to the hospital. 

Audie, Stanely, Sunshine and Shepard stay with Farmer in the hospital, waiting for him to recover. Shepard insists that they build a new rocket.  Farmer refuses, returning home a broken man.  With all hope lost, Audie finds out that Hal left her half a million dollars in his will.  She heads to the bank, ready to pay off the family debts.  However, when some of the locals start mocking Farmer, Audie stops her payment and rushes home.  She tells Farmer that they’ll use the money to build a new rocket.  The family begins work on a new rocket, rebuilding from the old wreck and preparing for a launch. 

The launch day arrives.  With the FBI still suspicious, Pepe decoys the agents out of town.  Farmer says a tearful goodbye to his wife and children.  The rocket takes off.  The entire town watches as Farmer blasts towards space.  Farmer loses control of his capsule, but after a brief struggle manages to fly back into the earth’s atmosphere.  With his family anxiously waiting, Farmer lands on the high plans of Montana.  Audie picks him in her car and drives him back home. Farmer’s dream has finally been realized.


COMMENTS:

This is an absurd but charming adventure about a man who refuses to let go of his dream.  There’s no way a Montana Rancher could ever single handedly launch himself into space, but the script is written in such a genuine way that it almost seems possible.  It’s this very deadpan nature of the storytelling that adds to the appeal, creating some very funny and heartfelt moments. Despite the fact that Farmer exhibits some poor judgment that could be interpreted as insanity, he’s so dedicated to his dream that it’s impossible not to root for his success.  While the ending comes a bit quicker than expected and pushes the envelope of far fetchedness at that point the suspension of disbelief has been so well maintained that you’re willing to accept it.  All in all a strange and entertaining story.  This is a consider.

LOGLINE 
The freshman class of Eastern University is the first to sleep in the East Hall dorms in sixty-five years.  They will soon find many dark secrets lurking in the former asylum. 

SUMMARY 

	We open on JANIE MCBRIDE, age 11, witnessing her father ELLIOT blow his own brains out.  Flash forward seven years, and JANIE is matriculating to Eastern University.  Her dorm is creepy, with menacing gargoyles lining the exterior.  A crazy homeless man named MACKEY warns her not to enter.  JANIE’S MOM gives her a St. Christopher medallion before they part.  JANIE tries it on in her bathroom, and immediately hallucinates that the necklace is barb wire, tearing at her flesh.  
	JANIE meets several of her dorm mates at an orientation meeting, including REZ, the tight-assed RA, and HOLT, the bad boy with a heart to whom she is immediately attracted.  REZ mentions during his orientation talk that the East wing of their building is still under construction and completely off limits.  JANIE, HOLT, and several other freshmen become friends immediately and drink tequila in HOLT’s room.  They decide to go and explore the east hall, which STRING, a nerdy 16 yeard old freshman, explains was a former mental asylum for teens, run by the nefarious Dr. Burkhardt.  
	While they explore, JANIE hallucinates again, this time seeing her brother JOSH commit suicide.  We find out that this suicide took place one year prior, during JOSH’s freshman year at Eastern.   In the midst of this, JANIE loses track of her friends and gets caught by security.  She takes the fall for the group, though CAMPUS OFFICER KELSO gives them all a stern talking-to.  REZ gives them a piece of his mind, as well.  In fact, his bullying drives STRING to want to leave school.  
	JANIE talks him into sticking it out, but when he is left alone he starts to see things.  In his room alone, he sees DR. BURKHARDT and begins to see scenes from his childhood, as his white trash parents belittle his intellect.  We see his limbs being bound with string, his flesh ripped from his body.  JANIE hears screaming and comes to his room too late, finding STRING alone in his room, hanging dead from a ceiling fan.  She immediately tells KELSO, who gets to the room to find nothing.  He assumes STRING left school.  JANIE hallucinates again, this time seeing barb wire descend from the ceiling to cut her in the shower.
	JANIE and HOLT research the asylum in the library, learning that BURKHARDT was tortured and killed by his own patients.  His next victim is IVY, the Orange County Queen Bee,  Ivy starts to see scenes of her FATHER, who molested her.  IVY disappears from the dorms.  Later that night, JANIE again finds STRING’s deceased body, and this time she encounters MACKEY, leading her to surmise that the crazy homeless man is actually the killer.  Meanwhile, DR. BURKHARDT goes after TOMMY, the jock.  TOMMY sees his obese MOTHER forcing him to overeat, as a child.  JANIE and HOLT find him on the floor, his mouth stuffed with food to the point of suffocation.  BURKHARDT appears, telling the two teens that he’s going to “cure” them, too, but MACKEY appears to save them.  He tells them how he was one of BURKHARDT’s patients—the only survivor.  We see a flashback of MACKEY, age 11, being lobotomized with BURKHARDT’s trademark dual-lobotomy pick.  The other PATIENTS are revolting, they place BURKHARDT in a barb wire jacket.  MACKEY manages to escape through a tunnel, though everyone else died in the asylum fire.
	Still on the run, MACKEY and crew run into REZ and MAYA.  As they hide in the bathroom, toilets burst into flames and the mirrors shatter, as DR. BURKHARDT emerges from a wall.  KELSO appears and attempts to shoot the apparition, to no avail.  The DOCTOR kills MACKEY with his lobotomy pick, and then kills KELSO by hugging him—he’s still wearing the barb wire jacket.  
	MAYA, another of the freshmen, foolishly allows the rest of them to escape the room and tries to fend off the DOCTOR herself.  She starts to see and feel scenes of her BOYFRIEND beating her, as her boyfriend morphs into the DOCTOR.  She is stabbed and killed with the DOCTOR’s lobotomy picks.  The rest of the group continues to explore the asylum, now finding dozens of charred bodies in the deep recesses.  JANIE sees a vision of one of the rooms, circa 1930; teenagers are chained to beds, begging to be saved from the evil DOCTOR.  REZ attempts to escape through a dumb waiter shaft, but JANIE stays to find HOLT, who has disappeared.  
	At the bottom of the shoot, HOLT finds himself trapped.  He begins to see scenes from his high school experience, as the pretty girls all tease him.  The DOCTOR talks about how REZ uses women now to cover up his pain.  Then, two EVIL CHEERLEADERS begin to chase him, as the basement is engulfed in flames.  He ends up another victim of the lobotomy picks.  
	The DOCTOR next happens upon JANIE and traps her in a padded cell.  HOLT comes to the rescue, and JANIE escapes to the next room, where she finds a human butcher shop, of sorts.  All of her friends – TOMMY, IVY, STRING, MAYA, KELSO, and MACKEY – are now rotting on the floor or suspended from the ceiling like slabs of meat.  She accidentally tips over a large vat and gets drenched with brine and severed human libs.  Gross. 
	Now, the DOCTOR is inside HOLT’s head.  He makes HOLT see visions of his little brother drowning in the family pool.  HOLT tried to give him CPR but it wasn’t enough.  This still haunts him; the DOCTOR summons a rush of water to drown HOLT where he stands.  JANIE rescues HOLT by hitting the DOCTOR with one of his own picks, as they discover the picks are his weakness.  
	They escape through the dumb waiter shaft and find a secret network of tunnels.  The DOCTOR catches up to them again, but HOLT hits him with a shovel.  JANIE then shoves a metal steam pipe through his chest.  They find a grate leading to the outside, but the DOCTOR shows up one more time, now a bloody mess.  He stabs HOLT in the chest and JANIE in the stomach with his picks.  JANIE sees the scenes of her FATHER and BROTHER’s suicides again.  The DOCTOR tells her he’ll cure her pain, but HOLT manages to snap her out of the hallucination, and  she lobotomizes the DOCTOR, who starts to emit beams of light and then…EXPLODES.  Pieces of the DOCTOR rain to the floor, and HOLT and JANIE are saved, though bleeding severely.  We end with the two survivors walking around the campus orientation festival, as a new group of kids enters the asylum, greeted by the DOCTOR’s catchphrase: “I’m here – to cure you.”


 COMMENTS

	Asylum is a very violent horror film with a supernatural premise.  The premise itself – a psychotic, psychic, undead Psychiatrist preys on the fears and flaws of college freshmen – is strong.  However, this script feels haphazardly written and there are many inconsistencies in the way the premise is carried out.  
	First, and most glaring, is that there is never a rationale given for the Doctor’s powers.  Though these kinds of movies are expected to involve great suspension of disbelief, there has to be something to explain why the Doctor would haunt the asylum/University and be able to torture and kill students.  Also, the nature of his presence in the building is never clearly defined.  At one point, Officer Kelso’s bullets pass right through his ghostly body.  Then, later, it is determined that his lobotomy picks are the only thing that can hurt him.  Then, completely contradicting these earlier developments, Holt and Janie manage to hurt him with a shovel and a steam pipe.
	Finally, the dialogue in some scenes is atrocious, especially during the early scenes of introductions between characters.  The old homeless man’s warnings are beyond cliché, and Ivy is not very believable as the stuck up rich girl (the line “Couldn’t you just eat his dimples?” made me wince, especially).  Hopefully this will be fixed in subsequent drafts.  
	Criticisms aside, the premise works.  The hallucination scenes, where the Doctor forces his characters to relive their traumatic experiences, are mostly fairly effective.  The characters are at a time in their lives when they are psychologically and emotionally weak, making them perfect prey for the Doctor.

READER: Steven Murphy

LOGLINE

Based on true events including rioting and mass protestation which disrupted the World Health Organization summit in Seattle in November 1999.

COMMENTS

The plot moves along very rapidly and is chock full of wonderful details.  The writer tries a bit too hard to humanize characters on every side of the issue in effort to create a rounded story, but its clear that his heart lies with the protesters, and some of his characterizations and dramatic choices are quite clunky.  The love story between Jay and Lou, as well as Django and Sam are silly and seem completely unimportant against the backdrop of such dramatic events.  They wind up serving to marginalize the story rather than enhance it (like having scenes from the OC transplanted to the WTO riots).  Many of the other characters are one dimensional (Jean wants journalistic integrity/ her boss is a ratings driven jerk/ Randal wants anarchy/ Dale wants to quit the force…) and the ensemble feels like a CRASH rip-off, trying too hard to show everyone’s perspective.  On the upside though, this story otherwise well written and highlights a major historical event that has not received much coverage.  I think that the ideals are very universal, and got very caught up in the clash between the government and the protestors.  I don’t think this is a prebuy based on the uneven script and Townsend’s short resume, but isn’t a bad project.


SUMMARY 

California 1997 - JAY and his brother DAVID protest deforestation in California, trying to stop loggers from cutting down ancient redwood trees.  The loggers ignore the protesters, cutting down trees despite the fact that some of the protesters are in the way.  A tree falls on David.   Jay begs a police officer for help and gets arrested. David dies.

Mexico 1997 – DJANGO, an animal rights activist tries to stop fisherman from killing sea turtles.   The Fisherman throw Django overboard.

Oregon 1997 – RANDAL and LOU (a girl) invade a pharmaceutical company and free a bunch of animals.  Lou lights the place on fire.

Seattle 1999 – Jay and Lou meet while hanging a protest banner on the Seattle Space Needle in preparation for their demonstration against the WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION, a global body that is the only force regulating worldwide trade.  Jay, Lou, Django, SAM (a nervous girl reluctant to be involved in such a dangerous protest) and thousands of other protestors have descended upon Seattle, protesting the trade agreements, laws and other injustices that they feel are being perpetuated by the organization (whom they believe is guilty of infringing on human/ animal rights as well as relegating third world countries to massive debts.)  Jay leads a group called DAN – Direct Action Network - that has been coordinating their protest efforts with the MAYOR of Seattle, and have been given permits to demonstrate in return for promising non violent protests.  Randal, Lou’s ex boyfriend, is working with an anarchist group that has a tentative alliance with DAN and threatens to undermine the peaceful protest by commiting acts of violence.  DAN’s plan is to gridlock the city by blocking all the major intersections, thereby forcing the trade talks to come to a halt.  

DALE and JOHNSON are cops who have been looking forward to the trade talks with a mixture of trepidation and excitement.  DALE’s wife is pregnant, and he dreams of quitting the force and traveling the world.  Johnson is far more gung ho and looks forward to bashing the protester’s heads in.  

Reporter JEAN heads to Seattle with the hopes that the trade talks will be a powerful story – she is getting frustrated appeasing her boss who only cares about ratings “If it doesn’t bleed, it doesn’t lead.”

On the first day of the talks, Jay and his group succeed, shutting down the talks by blocking all the major intersections.  The Mayor is forced to call in the national guard, and impose a curfew.  Jean interviews Jay, but her boss forces her to cut Jay out of the coverage, instead airing footage of the Anarchists destroying storefronts and inciting a violent riot.  

During the riot, Dale’s wife ELLA gets attacked by riot cops who mistake her for a protestor.  She gets hit in the stomach and has a miscarriage.  Johnson is sent into the fray undercover, his mission is to secure more tear gas and bring it back to the front lines of the skirmish.  During his mission he gets sucked into the crowd of protestors and actually bonds with them a bit, joining a drum circle and playing bongos.  

On the second day, tensions are running even higher.  The cops are ordered to attack and arrest protesters.  Johnson is very hesitant about his orders, but Dale, devastated by his wife’s miscarriage, takes them to heart and ruthlessly attacks protestors.  Django and Lou both get arrested.  

Jean, who has been given strict orders to go on a live feed with footage of President Clinton’s visit, rebels against her boss and goes live dressed like a protestor, with duct tape across her mouth.  Jean gets pulled from the air and arrested.

Dale chases Jay and beats him nearly to death.  Jay gets arrested.  The mayor is forced to cancel the trade talks, giving the protestors a major victory.  Sam (the nervous girl) convinces the mayor to let all of the protestors out of jail.  Jay and Lou kiss.

A reclusive writer tries to do a good deed by picking up a drifter; but the DRIFTER turns out to be a malevolent criminal seemingly bent on forcing the writer into delivering a “realistic” screenplay… the writer fears that the drifter may actually be a serial killer who has been on the loose in the area. 

COMMENTS
Mediocre thriller destined for late night TV;Vid value if Jackson works, but I don’t think this is a breakthrough theatrical thriller.   The story has a few major TWISTS; (the writer turns out to be the serial killer), but when a story relies so heavily on a major twist, it had sure better deliver, and for me the twist wasn’t very surprising and definitely didn’t make up for the fact that the plot is a series of questionable decisions frosted with shoddy logic.  Was based on a French TV series called  “Papillon Noir” but I think the French would shun this remake. Pass. 

SUMMARY
A struggling screenwriter RICHARD lives in a remote area of West Virginia; his wife has left him, he’s struggling to write and, to make matters worse – a serial killer is running loose in the area killing random women, which is driving down property value and making it damn near impossible for Richard to sell his home and cure his financial woes.   His real estate agent LAURA feels badly for him, but there’s not much she can do… he does manage to successfully ask her out for a date. 

RICHARD gets involved in an incident with a Trucker, and the two nearly run each other off the road.  RICHARD is terrified when the Trucker accosts him in a roadside diner and nearly attacks; Richard is defended by a strange DRIFTER who kicks the trucker’s ass.  RICHARD sees the DRIFTER walking home in the rain and offers the guy (Jackson) a ride. The drifter; JACK; agrees to come along and the two get along well; RICHARD even invites JACK to stay at his house for a home cooked dinner… when JACK gets there he takes over dinner preparations and Richard realizes having Jack around could be pretty handy. In exchange for room and board, Jack agrees to stay at the house and fix up a couple things; a broken screen door, loose boards on  a deck above a pond, and Richard is excited about the prospect that the handiwork will help the home’s resale value. 

The arrangement goes awry when Jack and Richard start talking in depth about writing; JACK gets very aggressive; holding a knife to Richard’s throat to demonstrate the fear a victim feels… and demanding that Richard stop drinking and write a story about “their story”: ie, a story about a drifter and a writer.  

Richard becomes a prisoner in his own home; JACK reviews the pages, throwing them into the fire when he is unhappy, and refusing to let Richard go out at all; Richard even misses his date with LAURA.

COMMENTS

This is a very emotional screenplay which does a very good job of painting a melancholy portrait of this tragic couple headed for divorce.  The problem is, the scripts emotional tone is very one note, tragedy follows tragedy and sorrows follow sorrows.  Two storylines run parallel, the beginning days and the final days of the relationship between Cindy and David contrast the changes in their lives.   Unfortunately, even the early stages of their relationship were mired in tragedy.  They both come from sad backgrounds,  he takes an awful job, and she is impregnated by a different man, BOBBY who stalks her and beats up David.  The thing that gives them the most joy, their daughter Frankie, is a constant reminder that their relationship has been one of constant sorrow, being that despite all of David’s love and devotion, Frankie is not his daughter.  David is a pathetic romantic and Cindy has grown tired of him.  She wants better things, and seeing Bobby happy and successful makes her jealous and embarrassed about her life.  It is painful to watch David struggle to fight for a marriage with a woman who gave up on him long ago.  The screenplay is well written, and with good performances I think that it could be moving, but I think that it is too dramatic and too sad for audiences to be drawn to it.

COMMENTS

Not terrible, but not particularly noteworthy. I disliked the lead actor’s performance; he was quite a wisp of an actor to be squeezed in between Anthony Hopkins and Laura Linney, and I thought that he, and the film by extension, wilted because of it. Every time he was on the screen the film was weaker for it.  The performances of Hopkings and Linney were enjoyable and strong, but didn’t entirely redeem the film.  The story is slow, definitely geared for older audiences only, and I don’t think that this will generate much interest, awards or otherwise.

COMMENTS

A quiet and tragic story that moves along well and is very compelling, though bleak.  Both TANJA and M are complex characters and there is a lot to be drawn from their stories-- indeed the film seems to be a search for meaning within the war tragedies of the late 20th century.  The script is well-paced and unexpected events unfold with a sense of inevitability that adds a great deal to the mood and atmosphere of the film.  The character of M could be a great acting vehicle for Liam Neeson.  Recommended buy.

SM COMMENTS 

I agree with the reader that the project has got merit; but DISAGREE that it’s a prebuy. Script was plagued by revolving largely around one twist; the twist that the MAID was actually a bodyguard hired to protect M; and the twist was pretty telegraphed... There is a lot of emotion here, but it's not a very substantial script, it seems short and thin and flat; like a small, romantic character piece featuring a slobadan milosevic type... it didn't quite have the scope and significance it should have. Another big problem is that Siberling is hardly an auteur, and for this to be commercial at all; it would need the sure hand of a master. Pass. 


SUMMARY

The film opens as M, a charismatic-looking older man, inspects a pepper in a small market.  The shopkeeper is being robbed at gunpoint, and M orders the gunman to stand up before violently disarming him.  M leaves and is picked up by his driver, MIRO, who holds M’s head down while tearing through the city streets.  We learn that M is a General, and MIRO tells him that he is moving again.  It is clear that M is a war criminal in hiding.

When they arrive at the apartment complex, a Soviet-era set of concrete buildings, M spends some time inspecting his room.  It is empty, and he arranges it to his liking, as well as testing how soundproof it is.  He is very methodical, though we see that behind his actions is a deep fear.

The next day M is surprised by a young woman entering his apartment.  He holds her at gunpoint and we learn that she is a maid, TANJA, who used to clean for the previous tenant.  M is very untrusting and forces her to strip and then shower before putting the gun away and demanding that as she has seen him and recognizes him, she must now work for him full time.

M takes TANJA shopping for food and talks about how he is invisible, how there are rumors of his presence everywhere, but the people who are looking for him will never find him.  The people who look out for him on the other hand, are ubiquitous, and he demonstrates this by taking TANJA on a brief run through the city, laughing at the cars of his watchers as they scramble to catch up.  

The next day M tries to learn more about TANJA, her life, friends, deceased parents, etc. and insists that he see her home.  He discovers that she doesn’t have much of a life and manages to get her to buy a nice dress.  When he demands his change back, she ignores him and buys him a new suit.  She is then surprised when he takes her dancing.  At the dance hall, he disappears into the bathroom and she sees men following him in.  Thinking that they are there to kill him, she bursts into the men’s room, gun drawn.  M is in no danger, but holding court—though he is angry to discover that she was not a maid to begin with, but another bodyguard.  He begins to choke her, but eventually collapses.  TANJA manages to avoid U.N. patrols and get him to a hospital and finally home.

M demands that they get a car, and after TANJA steals MIRO’s Yugo, they drive into the countryside, in the direction of M’s home village.  There are a few ominous signs along the way (ravens, an old blind woman at a tavern recognizes M) and TANJA insists that they not continue but M overrules her.  She has him crouch and give directions to the cemetery from the back seat, as there are policemen all over town.  They eventually reach the cemetery, and TANJA gets out to check if everything is clear.  She reaches the grave of M’s daughter and notices some suspicious shadows.  She turns to warn M but he is already out of the car.  She runs to reach him before he steps into eyeline of the shadows, but a shot rings out, and TANJA slumps to the ground, dead.  Another car pulls up, and MIRO grabs M and forces him in the car.  They drive off.

Some time later we see M locked in his apartment as if it is a cell, and as the military man who has replaced TANJA tidies up and leaves, the camera turns to M—a shell of his former self trapped in an imitation of life.

An Australian teenager deals with the trials and tribulations of caring for his autistic brother.

COMMENTS

	The Black Balloon is a well-executed drama.  The plight of Thomas Mollison, our protagonist, is one that most of us can relate to, because most of us, at that age, have felt “too cool” for someone in our immediate circle.  In Thomas’s case, he doesn’t want to become associated with his autistic brother.  The drama comes from the bond that Thomas and Charlie have; Thomas knows that Charlie’s entire life is, at times, dependent on Thomas remaining caring and vigilant.  One feels for Thomas, knowing that he puts so much work into caring for his brother, only to have to hear the taunts of his fellow students as the “special” bus passes their high school.   
	Thomas’s frustration manifests itself in several intense physical battles with Charlie.  On the page, these scenes affect you in a visceral way.  It’s clear that Thomas cares for Charlie, but he hates him for how difficult and complicated he makes everyone else’s lives.  On screen, I can only imagine the weight of these fight scenes.
	This script realistically portrays the struggles, as well as the all-too-brief moments of joy, that come with raising a handicapped child.  There are several moments of comedy thrown in, but this is by no means a crowd-pleaser. The dialogue is often clever, and the relationship subplot is well done.  Jackie provides a nice foil, helping Thomas realize the nobility in caring for his brother.  This is a well-told slice of life story, simple yet very moving. 

SUMMARY 

	THOMAS MOLLISON, an Australian army brat, has just moved to a new military community with his family.  His family instantly stands out due to his older brother, CHARLIE, who suffers from autism and attention-deficit disorder.  CHARLIE is a handful; he doesn’t speak, is rambunctious and reckless, and needs to be supervised constantly.  THOMAS is well aware of the attention CHARLIE attracts on the first day in town, though he certainly doesn’t go out of his way to stand up for his brother and the others on the short bus, his first day at his new school.  
	SIMON, the boys’ father, is constantly telling his wife MAGGIE to take it easy around the house.  She is 8 months pregnant, but continues to work through the exhaustion, taking care of CHARLIE every second that he’s home and raising hell.  This leads to a panic attack and an order from the Doctor to rest.  With SIMON working at the base full time and MAGGIE in bed, this leaves THOMAS in charge of his older brother.  One day THOMAS leaves the back door unlocked, and CHARLIE manages to run all the way to the affluent neighborhood nearby.  Before THOMAS can catch him, he runs into the bathroom of a strange house and starts to pee all over the bathroom.  The bathroom belongs to a classmate of THOMAS’, JACKIE MASTERS.  JACKIE MASTERS is in the shower.  They manage to escape without being identified.
	The next day at school, THOMAS and JACKIE are paired up as CPR partners in life-saving class.  They flirt and get along well; neither brings up the incident.  Later, JACKIE shows up at THOMAS’ house, and THOMAS panics, pushing CHARLIE into a bedroom so he won’t be seen.  In the bedroom, CHARLIE shits himself, prompting a scolding of THOMAS, by MAGGIE, with JACKIE within earshot.  JACKIE sees THOMAS carrying the soiled garments, prompting him to lash out and send her home.
	SIMON sees MAGGIE bathing CHARLIE again, and decides it’s impossible for MAGGIE to rest if she’s home.  He checks her into the hospital, leaving THOMAS in charge of most of CHARLIE’s day-to-day routine.  He has to ride on the short bus, administer medications, change, and feed CHARLIE.  He gets in trouble for mouthing off during life-saving class, but JACKIE (knowing that THOMAS needs to take care of CHARLIE immediately after school) helps him get out of detention.  That day, the three Mollison boys go grocery shopping, and CHARLIE has a screaming fit.  Back at the house, THOMAS rips up his brother’s good behavior chart, out of frustration, prompting another outburst and the shattering of some kitchen windows.  After things calm down, THOMAS asks SIMON if her ever wishes CHARLIE were normal.  SIMON tells him that they got Charlie because they are strong enough to deal with/care for him.	 SOCIAL WORKERS arrive at the house one day after complaints from a neighbor.  They question the family about Charlie’s bruises, seeming a bit suspicious.
	After school one day, THOMAS and JACKIE walk home with CHARLIE.  While they flirt (JACKIE is impressed that THOMAS speaks to his brother with sign language), CHARLIE begins to eat one of JACKIE’s tampons.  THOMAS has to wrestle him to the ground; JACKIE takes it all in stride, joking “Good thing it wasn’t a used one!”  The three of them go swimming and then THOMAS and JACKIE kiss, amidst a hailstorm.  In the next scene, baby sister SOPHIE is born and MAGGIE returns home.
	The next day, some of THOMAS’s classmates make fun of CHARLIE when they see him run off the school bus toward his brother and JACKIE.  CHARLIE flips out and punches one of the taunters, resulting in a huge scene and several teachers getting involved.  THOMAS is embarrassed and frustrated that he can’t keep his brother under control.  It is his birthday, and JACKIE comes to dinner at his house.  She tries to cheer him up with a mix tape, but THOMAS is sullen and unreceptive still.  At dinner, after THOMAS blows the candles out, the lights come back up to reveal CHARLIE masturbating and staring at JACKIE, who is mortified.  They can’t get him to stop.  THOMAS, furious, has to wash his brother’s hands.  In the bathroom, he picks a fight, which gets pretty brutal.  It’s broken up momentarily, but then THOMAS breaks his brother’s beloved Nintendo, and all hell breaks loose.  CHARLIE is taken to the hospital for stitches.  THOMAS cries hysterically, consoled by MAGGIE.  Later that night, he walks to JACKIE’s house and apologizes for the scene.  On his way home, he encounters CHARLIE, and we cut to the next day as they look upon one another.
	At class, THOMAS is teased for the events of the previous day.  They shut up when he strips to jump in the water, and they see his scars.  That night is CHARLIE’s big performance in the musical Cats, in a production with a 100% autistic cast.  THOMAS gets in better spirits when SIMON lets him drive, for the first time, to pick up JACKIE.  CHARLIE’s friend RUSSELL gets stage fright and refuses to perform, so THOMAS agrees to don the cat costume and take his place.  He joins CHARLIE and awkwardly dances, though they both appear as happy as can be.  We end on a scene with CHARLIE and THOMAS in the bath together.  THOMAS tells CHARLIE, who probably does not comprehend, that he used to wish his brother were normal, but now that he understands it can never happen, he’s okay with it.

COMMENTS
Based on one of the less popular works of Shakespeare (I’ve never heard of it and I minored in English and took three classes on Shakespeare); the story gets an updated polish, setting the tragedy in modern times, but using Shakespeare’s florid prose.  The result is sometimes inspired and sometimes stilted; it’s incongruous to hear the lengthy debates amidst the scenes of BlackHawk Down type war footage.   Fiennes is a first time director; this is going to be a tough one to pull off; and the lengthy, lengthy dialog will probably be tough to translate.   

SUMMARY 
MARTIUS is Rome’s most valiant soldier, leading his troops against the rebel VOLSCIAN forces led by AUFIDIUS; Martiu’s arch nemesis.  The fight is bloody and long, and at the end, MARTIUS and AUFIDIUS are face to face, battling unarmed… but the fight is disrupted by an explosion of an RPG and Aufidius’s men hasten a retreat, taking their injured leader with them. 

MARTIUS returns to Rome severely wounded.  His wife VIRGILIA and his friend Senator MENENIUS are upset; but his scheming mother seems proud and satisfied that he’s hurt, knowing that his wounds will translate into valor, and hopefully, political clout. 
MARTIUS gets honored with the name CORIALIANUS.  Reporters broadcast the noble soldier’s return, and a rosy political future seems assured. 

CORIOLANUS reluctantly goes on the campaign trail, disinterested in pleading with the common man to vote for him.  He is rebuked; “you have not indeed loved the common people.” 

CORIOLANUS does a good job with the crowd at first; but a pair of malicious instigators, BRUTUS and SICINIUS riles the mob against him.  A massive riot ensues after CORIOLANUS lashes out at the crowd. He is hustled away to safety as riot police try to salvage Rome from being destroyed by the irate looters.

During a televised debate, Brutus manages to bate CORIOLANUS into exploding. The crowd chants for Coriolanus’ banishment and he screams at them, calling them curs and insisting he’d be happy leaving Rome. 

CORIOLANUS heads to ANTIUM to find his nemesis AUFIDIUS; but rather than attempt to fight, Coriolanus offers to join forces with the Volscians to fight Rome. Aufidius is shocked and elated.  News reports break announcing “the VOLSCIANS ON THE MARCH.” Martius (as he’s now called again) leads the troops through the Roman defenses, straight into the heart of the city.  MENENIUS insists that the crowd who banished him go pray for his mercy. 

MENENIUS approaches the Volscian encampment and speaks to MARTIUS, but Martius rebuffs him immediately; sending him away, unmoved by his former friend’s pleas.  MENENIUS kills himself.

VOLUMNIA, VIRGILIA and YOUNG MARTIUS come to the camp and plea with him for the mercy of Rome.  At first Coriolanus is unswayed, but eventually, watching his noble mother kneel in the dirt; he is moved and agrees to show mercy to Rome, despite the fact that it means his death. 

CORIOLANUS asks AUFIDIUS to sign a peace treaty; knowing full well that AUFIDIUS will take it as an offense punishable by death.  CORIOLANUS is at peace; the VOLSCIANS shoot him mercilessly, but CORIOLANUS slits his own throat, robbing AUFIDIUS of the pleasure of killing him.

COMMENTS:
A sweet romantic comedy which actually made me laugh out loud a few times. Writing is silly at times in a 'The Office' kind of way. If this guy is really funny, it could very well be a film that could break him out (I am thinking Jim Carey in Ace Ventura). It still feels very Australian, but so was Babe. It also reminded me of 'About A Boy' at times. Animals have been working well in movies lately. One that the whole family can go to. For the right price, this is a fun film to have in your slate. I think the Queen music can add a lot to the film as well. Who doesn't like Queen?

COMMENTS

A flashy, stylistic gangster flick in the vein of a Guy Ritchie film featuring a large cast of characters ripe with easily identifiable quirks (one’s gay, one’s old, one’s a momma’s boy, etc) who all share a passion for misbehavior, fighting, drinking & cussin throughout.  The dialog and vivid imagery is exciting at first, and the premise seemed promising (one of the gangster’s has his heart broken) but the script has the feel of a flashy car that is spinning around in circles.  While Colin’s mind is unraveling, the plot is stalling  (they kidnap the guy, they beat the guy, Colin yells at him, they let him go). I kept waiting for something to happen, and by the end, was left disappointed, and all the hallucinations, flashbacks, rambling monologues and vignette style interludes weren’t enough to redeem it.

SUMMARY

Jarring images open the film, COLIN, a career thug, lies on the floor of a ransacked apartment.  LIZ jumps through a glass window and runs away from the apartment.  Colin has been devasted the news that LIZ has fallen for someone else. Colin’s buddies, (ARCHIE, a fellow tough guy, albeit one who lives with his mother, MEREDITH, tough but gay; MAL, tough but business like; and OLD MAN PEANUT, tough but old) decide to kidnap the LOVERBOY so Colin can reclaim his manhood by beating the cheater to death,  The gangsters beat Loverboy and hold him captive in a derelict household until Colin can summon the nerve to kill him.  While the others drink and carry on, Colin berates the LOVERBOY.  Colin’s emotions fluctuate wildly and his moods swing from murderous to tearful.  Just as Colin eventually resolves himself to kill Loverboy, bruised and battered Liz storms in. She breaks Colin’s heart, telling him that he doesn’t love her.  She begs him to help her, and we realize that he’s been hallucinating.  Liz isn’t in the derelict house, she’s bruised and battered from her fall, and lays dying on the side of a road… Much to the consternation of the other gangsters, Colin has a change of heart and decides to let Loverboy go.

Follows GEORGE, an Englishman in Los Angeles, coping with life after the death of his male lover. 

COMMENTS

Based on a classic novel that is marked as one of the standard bearers for gay literature, George is a character akin to Isherwood himself, a wise, funny, irreverent older man.  Goerge is destroyed by the death of his younger lover. The story tracks the professor’s last day of his life, and the pending suicide lends everything a melancholy air.  The dialog is romantic and florid, the pacing brisk and the flashbacks not overly wraught with sweetness, but I still found this to be an unremarkable piece.  Moore’s part is small, only really one notable scene, and imaging Colin Firth in this role isn’t very exciting.  Ford is a noted fashion icon, but a first time director.  Not a prebuy.

SUMMARY

GEORGE, a fit, happy 52 year old British proffesor living in a nice Los Angeles suburb has a nightmare where he sees his recently deceased lover JIM’s body mangled from a car crash.  George wakes with a start.  “Just get through the goddamned day.” 

FB – JIM and GEORGE appraise the house, GEORGE more nervous about the stir their presence in the neighborhood will create.

FB – JIM’s uncle calls to inform George that JIM has died in a car accident. 

A student of GEORGE’S, KENNY, approaches George after one of the professor’s impassioned lectures and asks George to join him for a drink, but George declines.  

George makes plans for drinks with his friend CHARLOTTE, a drunken British woman. He heads to a sport shop and buys bullets for his pistol.   George leaves suicide notes, one to Charlotte and one to his house keeper.  He gets dressed as if for an evening out, and puts the gun in his mouth, but doesn’t pull the trigger. 

His boorish neighbors are having a loud cocktail party across the street.  Their son, CHRISTOPHER startles George, and George threatens the kid. 

George goes to Charlotte’s house and has a drunken evening, they dance and smoke and talk wistfully about their past and argue and make unbelievable plans for the future. Charlie kisses George, almost desperately, and he bids her good night. 

George stops in for a night cap at his local bar and runs into Kenny who flirts again and suggests they go swimming.  They go back to George’s house and nearly connsumate their flirtation but George seemingly talks Kenny out of it.  George changes his mind about the suicide, hides the gun and burns his suicide notes, then has a stroke and falls to the floor dead, thinking of JIM during his final breath.

LOGLINE: A funeral home director convinces a woman who lived an unhappy life that she’s dead. Does he really have the gift to speak with souls in transition or is he a psychopath who buries people alive?

COMMENTS
This script started out unremarkably and felt quite predictable, although to be fair, the last 30 pages picked up the pace like an actual thriller. The story does strike a chord about whether an unfulfilled life merits a premature death, an idea that always manages to affect and discomfort. The ambiguity about Anna’s state was usually well-executed and Eliot’s character was certainly creepy, as well as his growing influence and tutelage of the young Jack.

Still, the ending felt unsatisfying and the ambiguity began to lose its appeal and its purpose, becoming vague and random for ambiguity’s sake rather than taking a decisive position. This is definitely better than the average supernatural thriller with an interesting nemesis and a “moral” of sorts, but the ending unfortunately unravels the careful tension and buildup of the second act. 

SM COMMENTS 

Lackluster writing, I wasn’t thrilled by this thriller.  Project was sold by First Look in Berlin 07, and I think this version has actually gotten a little bit worse after rewrites.   

SYNOPSIS (of old draft)
ANNA (mid-20s) is an unhappy teacher with a complaining unaffectionate mother BEATRICE and a fiancé PAUL who feels she doesn’t love him as much as he loves her. After talking with her lonely bullied student JACK, Anna goes to her piano teacher’s funeral where she is watched by ELIOT DEANE (40), the funeral home director. When Paul later announces he’s been made partner at work, Anna is upset because she’s always wanted them to go to New York. After arguing, she drives off, blacks out going by a truck and wakes up to see Eliot’s face. He tells her she’s dead, but she refuses to believe it. Yet she can’t feel any pain when Eliot stitches up her cuts. Eliot explains that he has a gift to speak with the dead and help them transition, and that those who struggled most with life continue to do so with death. Some let go immediately, others cling on until after they’re buried. She argues that she’s still breathing, and he dismisses it as her imagining symptoms of life in her inability to let go. He injects her with a relaxant to combat rigor mortis and she passes out. Beatrice comes to see her still body.

When a miserable Paul stops by the funeral home, Eliot doesn’t grant him access and Anna frantically beats at the prep room door to get his attention to no avail. She then tries to fight back, but Eliot subdues her saying that perhaps her life wasn’t really worth holding on to. Anna tries to escape again, stealing Eliot’s keys and running from the prep room to a phone where she calls Paul who is terrified and hangs up after hearing her hoarse creepy voice. Eliot tells her she is haunting Paul and not letting him go live his life. He shows her a mirror: she does look like a corpse. Jack, who has come by the funeral home after reading the news, peeks into the window and sees Anna standing.

Jack tells Paul he saw her, and Paul reacts by hitting him and calling him a liar. Eliot “talks” with another body, but we only hear his side of the conversation. When Jack goes back to the funeral home, Eliot knows Jack saw Anna and tells him he has the gift of empathizing with the dead, and he can teach him to help them transition. A desperate Paul appears again, trying to see one last time if Anna actually is alive, and pounds on the prep room door. By now, Anna has accepted her death and doesn’t answer, trying to let Paul go. Paul researches frantically and discovers a drug called hydronium bromide that can simulate death and suspend animation, plus the coroner signed Anna’s death certificate without actually seeing her body. Meanwhile, Jack helps Eliot dig a grave spot, and Eliot says he’s burying Anna not because she’s dead but because there’s no life left in her. He sees waking corpses all the time, doing nothing with their lives. He talks with Anna about what she really wanted, and she realizes moving to New York wouldn’t have changed a thing. Eliot opens the door for her, offering her another chance, but she doesn’t step through: she’s glad she’s dead. Eliot is disappointed that she’s like all the other who are scared of death but even more frightened by life. 

Just as her funeral begins, Eliot injects her with hydronium bromide and Anna realizes just before fading that her breath fogs up a mirror: it’s real! As the funeral ends, the casket lid is screwed shut as Anna awakes. Paul senses something is wrong but he’s also a bit drunk and disheveled. Anna tries to get out as they bury her. Paul gets even more drunk at the wake, and when Eliot tells him we’re all corpses one way or another, Paul realizes Anna might be alive. Eliot whispers that there’s not much air left in the casket and Paul runs off to unbury her. Jack tells him to fasten his seatbelt. Paul drives off as Eliot calmly gets in his own car. As Paul drives, a car seems to swerve at him but it may have been his imagination and he continues on, not realizing his car clock has stopped at 8:54 PM. Paul unburies the coffin and opens it to find Anna dead, eyes wide open, fingers torn and bloodied from scratching at the lid. Paul weeps and stumbles back into his car, where a seductive Anna suddenly appears and kisses him, saying she’s been waiting for him. It’s still 8:54 PM. Jack, riding with Eliot, asks him if it’s over now.

Paul awakens in the funeral home, Eliot’s face hovering over him and saying he’s dead. Paul denies it as Eliot wearily shakes his head, saying they’re all the same.

COMMENTS
There’s a short treatment available, and if you have interest in the project, it would be worth it to read.  It’s from the makers of PARANORMAL ACTIVITY which generated quite a bit of good word of mouth during AFM:  The treatment is a loose guideline  as the filmmaker likes to use a lot of improvisation.  Film will be shot in a verite style, a la Blair Witch.  I liked the fact that it makes the alien phenomenon seem very convincing and scary;  interesting for popcorn. I havent’ seen director’s first one, unfortunately.

SUMMARY
CHRIS leads his more reluctant buddies on a wild, strange vacation – they head to Nevada to investigate AREA 51.  Chris is not just your average Alien enthusiast, he has come prepared with an elaborate plan to break into the legendarily secure base. Using his friends as teammates and a diversion, and advice from local experts, and former “abduction” survivors, CHRIS manages to break in to Area 51. The first layer is seemingly innocuous, but on the second level down Chris and his buddy find what is clearly an extraterrestial flying craft being reverse engineered.  They deeper, tension mounting, as they invade the highly secure area during off hours.  Chris’ buddy wants to get out, but Chris is resolute.  On the bottom level they are terrified to find actual Aliens, and the two  immediately rush out, posing as security guards and taking the bases commuter jet plane back to safety.  Chris managed to find info indicating the name of a future abductee and he and his buddies, along with a friendly daughter of a local “abductee” go to her house on the night of the proposed abduction. Despite their efforts, the daughter is abducted by aliens and disappears, never to be seen again.

Born with the ability to detect a lie in the blink of an eye, Teddy Redmond coasts through life until his long absent father comes knocking at his door and uses his son’s ability to profit financially.

SM COMMENTS

I have mixed feelings about this one; solid B list project, but we hear that Pacino and Gillenhaal aren’t attached, which makes it more iffy.  The script jumps around and doesn’t give the audience much by way of clarification, a style similar to Gaghan’s other scripts, and at times, it feels a bit like the effort being put in to comprehend the situations are setting up expectations that aren’t really met in the end.  The greatest highlight for me was Pacino’s role; Pacino these days takes great pleasure in creating bombastic, loud characters and this one stood out; overshadowing pretty much every other element, particularly TEDDY, whom, despite his uncanny talents, was otherwise a pretty dull guy, (and one who is sexually attracted to 14 year olds to boot).  Maybe its sour grapes, but the very fact that this is essentially a story about a young guy choosing whether or not he wants to make a crapload of money without much effort rubs me the wrong way considering the circumstances in the world… My comments skew a bit more negative than they should; I enjoyed reading it, it was brisk, exciting at times (particularly a scene where TEDDY uses his ability to accurately bet on horse racing) and definitely skillfully written, but I was hoping for a bit more.

SUMMARY

TEDDY REDMOND has long held the ability to absorb all that was going on around him in a single glance. Now, on the cusp of either failing out of NYU or graduating after several years, 24 year old Teddy is at a crossroad. His mother PATRICIA wants him to be like the other well-to-do sons in her social group and become a stockbroker or something of that ilk.   She warns him not to be seduced by his absentee father, who would prefer that TEDDY join his firm; the high flying global finance corp known as REDCAP (short for Redmond Capitol).

Teddy, who volunteers as a student mentor, uses his “ability” to point out the guilty culprit among a group of elementary school youths destined for detention. He helps a kid, JOSE M., as he labors over his reading. Teddy seems happy when Jose M. correctly pronounces the word “teatime.” At the NYU guidance counselor’s office, Teddy sees a flyer for Teach for America and grabs it. 

Teddy’s father (REDMOND) is not excited about the idea of his son going into teaching, and his fellow graduate friends think he’s crazy for not jumping at a job offer from his father but Teddy is reluctant to trade happiness for a high-powered management job.

Teddy participates in a psych study observing the ability of humans to act as a lie detector. Teddy does phenomenally in the study, gaining the attention of PROFESSOR KRIZAN. 

Redmond takes Teddy on a helicopter ride to one of his holdings, Alleghany Steel, where he sees his father in action on the plant floor. Teddy notes that his father is torn between his management responsibilities and his early roots as a union boss. He also sees a brief expression of self-loathing and sadness appear on his father’s face. 

Teddy takes Jose M. to a museum and randomly meets AMANDINE BRUGES. They immediately connect and Teddy gives her his phone number.  Teddy later finds out that Amandine is actually only 14 years old.

Teddy meets Professor Krizan at a racetrack. Krizan tests his “human lie detector ability” by forcing Teddy to tell him which horse he thinks is going to win and then betting thousands of dollars on the horse. Teddy’s horse wins, and Teddy finally believes that maybe he does have a special ability.  Krizan gives Teddy the run down on micro-expressions and action units (a method for identifying expressions in relation to emotions).  

Teddy’s keen ability to notice people’s minute facial expressions gives him the ability to tell what people are really thinking even before they open their mouths.
Teddy shows Redmond his ability. Redmond is of course skeptical at first, but when everything that Teddy tells him turns out to be true, Redmond sees unique possibilities with Teddy’s gifts. Redmond asks Teddy to pick from a trio of judges, which judge would be more sympathetic to the bankruptcy case that he is going to file for his steel company. Although Teddy has reservations about “fixing” the trial, he bends to his father’s will, because for the first time in his life, his father is showing him attention and even admiration. Teddy narrows it down to one judge, JUDGE DORIS DUNN. Judge Dunn has the unique ability to remain expressionless, thereby thwarting Teddy’s ability to predict how she will rule. Teddy becomes obsessed with figuring out Judge Dunn’s character.

He goes to Krizan who tells him, that he has to catch Judge Dunn in a moment of unguarded emotion. Teddy sets up a situation at the park where he persuades Jose M. to pick a fight with Dunn’s blind Chinese daughter. When Dunn goes over to break up the fight, Teddy sees that Dunn is more sympathetic towards Jose M. than she is towards her own daughter, who she thinks provoked the fight. From this, Teddy ascertains that Dunn will be the perfect one to side with Allegheny steel’s management and not the union, as she “sided with the bully.” 

Teddy gets deeper and deeper into Redmond’s world, staying late and brokering deals until one day he looks across the his office and sees his dad and realizes he is looking into a reflection of himself (metaphorically). He sees the same reflection of self-loathing and sadness in himself that he has been noticing in his father.

Teddy goes to Dunn’s house and tells her that everything has been a set up and that she was cherry picked for this case. Redmond is furious at Teddy for sabotaging the case. Teddy tells Redmond that he loves him despite it all. Cut to: Teddy teaches a classroom full of underprivileged youth.

The plot is a thinly veiled excuse to take us from one overwhelming fight to the next… great pains were made to create colorful characters, but the story is written like a second rate comic.  The action could redeem it, but on the page this is a bit of a mess and was a very tedious read.  Each battle is SO over the top that there’s never any suspense or tension, the plot opens on full throttle and has nowhere to go from there.  Despite the fact that this has a strong cast, I think it’s a pass. 

SUMMARY

A mysterious DRIFTER (Josh Hartnett) and an ardent young Japanese warrior YOSHI (Gackt) on a mission both arrive in a town that is terrorized by outrageous and virulent criminals. Each obsessed with his separate mission, and guided by the wisdom of THE BARTENDER (Woody Harrelson) at the Horseless Horseman Saloon, the two eventually join forces to bring down the corrupt and contemptuous reign of NICOLA (Ron Perlman), the awesomely evil 'woodcutter' and his lady ALEXANDRA (Demi Moore), a femme fatale with a secret past.

Nicola’s days of running the town are passed; he now spends his time seeking more pleasurable pursuits and eagerly awaiting the birth of his son.  His second in command NO. 2, has been placed in charge of eliminating any threats, but fails to restrain YOSHI.  Yoshi, who has come to town to retrieve a family heirloom, is a master samurai (despite claims that he has taken a vow of peace) and Yoshi fends off Nicola’s army of goons easily, while hunting the gangster.  NO 2 enlists the help of the corrupt CHIEF of police, who arrests Yoshi and has the INVESTIGATOR and two goons beat him mercilessly.  

The DRIFTER and the BARTENDER team up to help Yoshi escape. While Yoshi recovers from his wounds, the Drifter takes Yoshi’s money and enters a high stakes poker game against NICOLA.  The Drifter is disappointed to find that Nicola is not actually at the game, he participates via satellite.  The drifter wins the poker game and Nicola agrees to meet him in person for a one on one late night poker game in an alley…  but the set up is a trap.  The Drifter is attacked.   

While the Drifter fights the army of goons, NO 2 accosts Yoshi’s UNCLE and cousin MONOKO. No 2 demands information about Yoshi’s whereabouts and kills UNCLE.  Monoko is kidnapped.  Yoshi has no idea they are under siege because he has left to repay his debt to Drifter, helping him fight the legion of goons.  

When Yoshi finds out that his Uncle is dead, his resolve hardens.  The two team for a climactic showdown, and Yoshi barely manages to kills NO. 2.  

Drifter kills NICOLA and reveals that he has been seeking revenge: Nicola had killed the drifter’s father.

COMMENTS 
Grandiose star vehicle for Costner that winds all over the place; new characters are being constantly introduced until almost halfway through the script and the result is an overloaded script with underdeveloped characters.  There are some poignant moments and a bit of a Cinema Paradiso vibe sprinkled throughout – the Germans and Americans are united solely by their love of movies…  but this detail  seems odd and out of place. There’s a love story, a bond between enemies, action, a chase, a prison break… but the problem is the script almost seems like a random jumble of exciting events rather than a cohesive story. Pass. 

SUMMARY 
AUGUST 1944 
WWII POW camps are springing up around America. SHERIFF CARSON tries to maintain business as usual as the US government ships German POW’s into their town.  The Germans disrupt life in the town. Local punks including their brash leader, STUART, clash and fight with some of the Germans.  The local girls, notable VAUDINE, a red hot farmer’s daughter, agitate things by flirting with the prisoners.  A German officer VON FALKENBERG; a stoic man, and a mirror image of CARSON, arrives at the camp and is displeased by the way the Nazi prisoners are acting. The Nazi’s bully the other German prisoners and make life in the camp tougher than necessary.  Von Falkenberg is clearly moderate, politically. 

A young German officer WEISS, actually gets murdered by his fellow inmates, the Nazis; BENSON, the US ARMY head of the camp reprimands the Germans officers: “It’s your job to keep order within your ranks!” 

Young VAUDINE, is found to be pregnant, and her father, the farmer LESTER says she was raped by one of the German POW’s. 

CARSON is suspicious of VAUDINE’s story and finds out that she’s really pregnant from sleeping with JULIO, a good-looking 17 year old Mexican farmhand.  He drives Vaudine to the border and forces him to go back to Mexico. “Don’t expect that girl to come looking for you.” 

VON FALKENBERG and nine other German POW’s use a rainstorm as a distraction and make a break from the prison; a NAZI officer, GRUEBER sees them and joins them – much to their chagrin. 

CARSON and BENSON are both on the hunt; the local boys, including STUART, decide it’s up to them to “join the war” and they also start to hunt the Germans.   VON FALKENBERG’S number two man KLEINERMAN gets fed up with being on the run; he’s thirsty and beaten down by the dessert and eager to surrender.  CARSON manages to catch the majority of the fugitives, but KLEINERMAN, GRUEBER and VON FALKENBERG are still on the run when STUART catches up to them in a dessert and shoots Kleinerman in the gut. “Why did they shoot? I would have surrendered?” 

The boys are shocked by the damage STUART has wrought with just one bullet. When Stuart kills KLEINERMAN by shooting him in the head they all want to leave but he bullies them into continuing the chase.  One of the punks, EUGENE, falls off a precipice and breaks his own neck. Grueber quickly follows him and kills himself by jumping to his death.  Carson berates Stuart, holding him responsible for the three deaths. He punishes the boy by mortifying him: Carson reveals that to the entire group of boys that Stuart is a coward who cried and pissed himself in order to avoid being drafted for the war.  

CARSON tracks down Von Falkenberg in the desert; the German Officer is wounded and weary, but begs Carson for a reprieve. He wants Carson to let him go to the ocean… he knows that after the war he will be shipped to a Russian gulag and likely killed by Stalin.  Carson acquiesces and the two men actually share a moment of peace when they wade into the water of the pacific.  

STUART however, has tracked them down. He shoots Carson in cold blood.  As Carson is dying, he tells Von Falkenberg to take his identity so that the German can live as a free man.

NEW COMMENTS
This draft is a lot better than the first draft; similarly, Owens is a much better choice than Paul Walker had been, and this reads like a draft that was punched up by Stephen Gaghan.  The script has weaknesses, but it’s definitely a lot smarter than most popcorn action scripts around; will have video, TV value and the Mexican Border was topic sets up some exciting sequences. Not for arthouse, but could be good for popcorn depending on price. The downside would be the topic is one a lot of unsuccessful films have focused on; if the price is right this could be good but don’t pay for a huge blockbuster.
 
SUMMARY
HOMBRE, a badass British bodyguard who is a legend in the protections field, is placed on a team charged with guarding a MEXICAN government official who is a witness against a brutal gang of underworld gangsters led by the vicious, INFANTE.  The protection squad can’t guard the family well enough, and the official & his wife are brutally murdered, but the official’s daughter manages to escape with Hombre’s help.
 
The official’s daughter, LUCY and HOMBRE race for a safe spot at a Priest’s hideaway, but INFANTE and his men are close behind, and they have the power of corrupt government officials at their call.
 
HOMBRE vows to take LUCY to the border but insists she must cross by herself.  They get into a vehicle led by PILATE, a mule, who is smuggling immigrants over the border, but the plan is a double cross; a SOLDIER arrives and kills one of the immigrants ALMA who was carrying drugs on her person.  HOMBRE attacks and saves the other immigrants by killing PILATE and the SOLDIER.  Lucy and Hombre continue heading towards the border.
 
HOMBRE brings her to an illegal border crossing and leaves with barely a word; but on his way back through the desert sees an AFI SUV (the Mexican FBI) which he knows is after her, and in cahoots with Infante.  HOMBRE has done his job… but he has a change of heart and turns around and races back to help her.
 
HOMBRE crosses the border into lower Phoenix hoping to find Lucy before Infante and his men can.  Hombre meets JAVIER, a local thug (who happens to be Alma’s son.) Hombre gets Javier to help him find Lucy; Javier thinks he recognizes her and brings Hombre to a sweatshop where immigrants often work; Hombre tortures the foreman and interviews an old woman there, who tells him that the pretty girl immigrants are taken to a place called “la casa.” Hombre kills the corrupt foreman.
 
After evading a chase from Infante’s men, HOMBRE heads to La Casa, which is a strip club/ sex club type place. He uses incredible hand to hand combat skills and accurate marksmanship to kill Bouncers and private bodyguards.
 
LUCY is being held, drugged, in a back room. During the melee she begins trying to escape.  She manages to kill her captor and flee. HOMBRE and Infante are both rushing for her. Hombre enters the room that was her prison and finds her gone.
 
Hombre and Javier wind up saving her from Infante; the press spins the story to say that Hombre, a British mercenary has kidnapped Lucy and killed a bunch of people. The manhunt is on.
 
INFANTE and his men gear up to kill LUCY before she can make it to court to testify against the Mexican crime bosses.  HOMBRE puts her in a disguise and they march to court in the midst of a group of protestors. In the court building, INFANTE and HOMBRE get into a battle and HOMBRE kills Infante. Lucy battered but alive, makes it into the court room and her testimony seals the crime bosses conviction.

A former US government elite agent encounters and rescues a twelve year old girl who’s been kidnapped by the Triads; and they quickly find themselves trapped between the Triads, the Russian Mafia, the police and city hall.

COMMENTS
This script had a ton of potential; it’s full of all the elements that one would think would make for an exciting, and smart thriller; but actual execution is SLOW and overwrought; there are too many twists and turns, too many stories being woven together and the writer’s lose control… despite the frequency of the action and the huge body count, there’s no real tension or drama throughout.  Good role for Statham, but its nothing we haven’t seen before time and again; also the director is not particularly known for his action work and REMEMBER THE TITANS, despite making money, was not particularly well directed or gritty; for this to work, it would need to be in the hands of a Ridley/ Tony Scott or some elite director.  Not terrible, but not the A List project it would seem to be.  Could have TV / Vid value.

SUMMARY
MEI, a twelve year old math genius in Shanghai gets selected to move to a school for gifted children; but gets kidnapped by the Triads and shipped to NYC to work for criminals in the Chinatown underworld. She is employed as a “counter,” memorizing figures for the mob bosses so they can avoid having a “paper trail.”

LUKE, a UFC fighter, accidentally kills an undermatched opponent; he’s got ties with the Russian mob and was meant to throw the fight; his failure to do so results in the Russians killing his pregnant wife and putting a bounty on his head.  Luke loses everything, and quickly begins living like an itinerant; a bum. Even the cops know him and turn against him; ruthlessly beating him and imploring him to kill himself.

MEI is asked to memorize an extremely important number sequence; but the Russian Mafia opens fire on her caravan, killing Triads and kidnapping her.  EMILE DOCHESKI, the Russian mob boss demands she tells him the number, but she refuses.  The cops surround the place and demand to open up; it turns out the cops are all corrupt; CAPTAIN WOLF is hiring out their services to the highest bidder and he pits the head of the triads against the head of the Russian mob; in the meantime, MEI manages to slip away.

 MEI manages to escape, but likely doesn’t stand a chance – she’s on her own and running from both the Triads and the Russian Mafia.  LUKE, suicidal, is about to jump in front of a subway train when he sees MEI getting chased by the mobsters. He springs into action and we see his ruthless, elite soldier/ UFC fighter skills in action as he kills Russian Mobsters and saves Mei’s life.

MEI is reluctant to side with LUKE; she’s terrified of him, but he manages to assure her that he’s only trying to help.

They try to hide out in a hotel but the Triads are close on their tail.
LUKE and MEI figure out that the numbers are the combination to a safe. 
The Triads burst into the hotel; LUKE kills a lot of them, but MEI winds up getting split up from him and nabbed by YAO CHENG; one of the Triad leaders; and despite his amazing fighting skill, there’s nothing Luke can do.

LUKE takes a different course of action and heads for the heart of the Russian Mafia empire; killing several mobsters and taking VASILY, EMILE’s son, hostage. Luke uses him as leverage to find out that the Triads and the Russians were going to do a SAFE EXCHANGE, handing each other two safe combinations to do a handoff to each other.  EMILE tells him where to find the safe MEI knows the combo to; and tells him that it contains 30 million dollars.

LUKE turns to his old contacts on the police force (he used to be a secret agent who killed possible terrorists in league and was helped by the NYPD, but turned them all in for being corrupt).  LUKE gets them to help him burst into the Chinatown lair that contains the safe; he manages to break into the safe using Mei’s combo; before killing a bunch of triads and several corrupt cops. LUKE and CAPTAIN WOLF leave with 30M in cold hard cash.  LUKE double crosses WOLF, tying him up and stashing him in the back of an SUV with VASSILY.

LUKE finds out that the criminal conspiracy goes to the highest levels; the MAYOR of NYC is involved, and it even goes all the way up to the VICE PRESIDENT of the US.  LUKE breaks into gracie mansion and breaks into the other safe; containing records of all the illicit activity the corrupt politicians conducted; LUKE know has the money and the loot; and uses it to retrieve MEI’s safety.

The mastermind is ALEX; one of the Mayor’s aides (who has ties to the whitehouse).  LUKE kills ALEX.

LUKE returns the money and loot to the gangs in order to ensure that he and MEI remain, “safe.”

Video stuff, and if I had to create a name for the genre I’d call it “disaster porn.” The characters are paper thin and I cared about them so little that when one of them explodes nearly a third of the way through the script I had to backtrack to figure out which dude it was… and still didn’t really care after coming to the bottom of it. Effects driven thriller that is for popcorn only…  Could be good for Middle East but there’s got to be some better popcorn scripts out there. This one is not spectacular in any way.

Saw this film this afternoon.  It is certainly enjoyable and raises some interesting questions about this crazy culture and society of celebrities.  It holds a mirror up to Hollywood and really examines the relationship between star and paparazzi – how they both need each other and one cannot exist without the other.  Grenier is fantastic and has such a great presence.  His “experiment” somewhat turns on him when he tries to act as a paparazzo to his own 14 year-old paparazzo, sort of to give him a taste of his own medicine.  When he realizes what he has done and created, he wants to show young Austin what he has become through the process.  Young Austin’s mother tries to be a voice of reason and modicum of decorum however, by treating her son like an adult when he is a young teen only exacerbates his precocious behavior.  I actually wish this story line was explored a bit further.

Great on-camera stuff with Grenier, Paris Hilton, Lindsey Lohan, Matt Damon and Eva Longoria, which essentially make this star-studded.  Grenier and Paris Hilton sort of stage a fake relationship just to heighten the media frenzy and see how fast and tenuously rumors can be started.  Film will definitely have a lot of resonance in the UK for that reason!

Overall, this is completely enjoyable and does offer a lot for discussion.

There are apparently two offers for Australia already – Hopscotch and Madman, and in the UK there are offers from Independent, Icon and Revolver, and David anticipates another from The Works in Berlin.  I can see this film being a sensation in those two territories and asked David about its resonance in France – he thinks it’ll be huge due to the likes of Paris Match magazine, etc.  I think this culture exists in every country – my question is will the whole world buy into the Hollywood of it all?  I strongly suggest that everyone have a look for themselves as it is certainly worth checking out.

SUMMARY
When precocious 13-year-old paparazzo Austin Visschedyk snapped a photo of celebrity Adrian Grenier from the hit HBO series ENTOURAGE, little did he know his life was about to change. Turning the tables on the juvenile paparazzo, Grenier stepped on the other side of the lens in an attempt to mentor a teenager obsessed with the lure of the Hollywood lifestyle. Exquisitely layered, TEENAGE PAPARAZZO moves beyond personal documentary, charting a cultural revolution of celebrity obsession that may have been born in the United States but stretches across the globe.

SUMMARY
A white cop, HARLAN has sex with a black woman LENDA, whom we later find out is married to another detective on the same police force, JESSE BROOKS.
 
HARLAN’s wife LEANNE is very religious and forces him to join her at church; but the service is interrupted when a bizarre man named DOC tries to kill a young virtuoso preacher, JOSHUA CARPENTER. DOC brandishes a gun and charges the altar, but HARLAN saves the child preacher. During the crossfire the pastor gets shot; he starts speaking in tongues while losing blood rapidly, and claims that “the enemy is among us! The End of Times is upon us”
 
JESSE and HARLAN are put on the case and realize that they are in the midst of  a “holy war” between two religious organizations, the United Confederation of Churches and a shady rival named the Assemblies of the Purifying God.
 
Meanwhile a FAT MAN and “MICHAEL” have a confrontation and FAT MAN winds up slitting his own throat.  Michael seems to be some sort of demon.
 
The detectives head to the Confederations offices where they meet another young genius, a girl named KATIE.
 
KATIE tells the detectives that her spiritual tutor; DOC, has already told her the cops would be looking for him and gave her the address. The cops go to arrest doc, but FBI agents also arrive on the scene and pandemonium ensues; gunfight erupts between the FBI agents / the cops/ and MICHAEL, who arrives on scene.
 
The detectives manage to apprehend DOC and bring him away.   After the gunfight, HARLAN is shaken up and realizes that JESSE likely saved his life; Harlan wants to confess to sleeping with LENDA but Harlan beats him to the punch; he’s known about it all along.

Bank robbers escape a road block by stashing the loot in an innocent families car; but retrieving the cash proves to be a violent, bloody ordeal. 
 
COMMENTS 
Video.  I don’t see cast attachment yet, but this is a middle of the road video title; maybe small theatrical, but its just pure action, with minimal attention paid to story, character, etc.  Pure smashem up sequences back to back with car chases, fist fights gun fights, even the teen son gets in on the action.  Piece of Business, not highly recommended; its late night cable tv fodder, without much breakout potential.  
 
SUMMARY 
NATE and his family are going on a road trip; he’s organizing a camp out in order to bond with his teen sons SHANE and KEVIN.  His wife ROBYN seems nonplussed by the trip as well. 
 
Meanwhile, armed robbers MAREK, ARIELLE, EVERS and LOSADA are making a getaway from a bank heist; they hear on a police scanner that they cops are setting up a roadblock on the highway and know that they’ll get caught if they pass through with the money.  
 
Marek improvises a plan: he’s gonna stash the money in the innocent family’s camp gear, and catch up with them after the roadblock.  The other crew isn’t happy about the plan, but they go along with it. 
 
After the roadblock, the gang speeds up and starts chasing the SUV. Nate freaks and starts speeding and winds up getting pulled over by a cop.  The gang panics, blaming Marek.   Nate, is turns out, has a criminal record and has violated his parole; he’s going to jail.  
 
That night, the family brings all their gear and stays in a motel while Nate lies in a holding cell; The crew invades the hotel room, nearly killing Robyn, but they can’t find the money.   They get away before the cops catch them.  
 
Back on the road, the family is torn and upset; blaming Nate for the situation. The Sedan of gangsters is still on their tail.  When Robyn finds the bag of money, she assumes that her ex con husband is IN ON the plan and flips out; leaving him and speeding off with the boys. 
 
NATE is alone in the middle of the desert with a heavy duffel bag full of money. 
 
MAREK and the gang catch up to the SUV and crash into it; knocking it off the side of the road.  Shane defends himself, knocking Evers into a cactus and knocking ARIELLE on her ass. MAREK beats up the 14 year old, ending the skirmish. He hops in the SUV to find NATE while the rest of the gang, EVERS and LOSADA, are left behind, “you can catch up.” Evers finds Nate by the side of the road; NATE wants to make a trade, the money for his family. 
 
They arrange an exchange at the mile marker where Nate stashed the bag, but when he gets there the money is gone.  Realizing the crew has no guns, Nate thinks quick and creates a diversion so ROBYN and the boys can get away; she manages to pick him up and the SUV makes a getaway. They stop by a cop, LT PAOLO, and beg for help as the sedan approaches; but the sedan crashes directly into them, killing the Lieutenant. 
 
They have to take off on foot; running through the desert.  They find a Railroad worker and beg for help, but EVERS kills him with the cop’s rifle. The crew gets into a fight with themselves and MAREK kills ARIELLE, to prove he’s still loyal to the crew.  
 
The family hops in the dead railroad workers car and tries to make a getaway. 
 
They find an abandoned shack; NATE stays behind, to defend them from the gangsters.  Shane finds a gun, and the bag of money. They stand tall for a standoff; and open fire on the crew; 
 
They manage to kill the gangsters and survive, but during the fight the shack explodes and the money burns up. They chuckle grimly; happy to have survived the ordeal.

Steve COMMENTS
 It’s definitely a tough script on the page because the plot is less important than the emotional moments which are layered on top of each other, thicker and thicker until we start finally realizing the root of the pain and the torment in this woman’s life; it’s interesting to wonder what could have happened to make grown women on the street attack her… or wonder how someone to be ostracized so thoroughly… and the Kevin character BLX, FR, IT, SW should read this, maybe SCANDI, PORT; not for others.  Director of Morvern Caller and Ratcatcher, this film is driven by the same overwhelming grief that drove Morvern Caller.  Interesting; if it were a different director I wouldn’t bother reading as I wasn’t blown away by the script, but with Ramsay it will have merit. Small arthouse. 
 
SUMMARY
EVA, a middle-aged woman with a tragic past, wakes to find that her house and car have been covered in red paint.  Reacting stoically, she readies her car for a drive, and heads off to a job interview at a travel agency.  After getting the job, she walks into the parking lot, where she is confronted and violently attacked by two women in their 40’s.  EVA shrugs off any assistance and gets into her car.  As she moves through her days with the listlessness of surrender, we see her life up to now in a series of flashbacks.
 
The flashbacks are fragmented and we catch glimpses of EVA rushing to a high school, where there has clearly been a monumental tragedy– there are police cars and ambulances, and groups of shocked teenagers.  The memories then go back to an earlier time, when EVA and her husband, FRANKLIN are enthusiastically making love, following them through the birth and childhood of their eldest son, KEVIN.  It is clear that KEVIN is not a normal child, as he is uncontrollable, spiteful, and seems to have taken an instant dislike to his mother, while spoiling his father, FRANKLIN, with seemingly feigned good behavior.  He exhibits clear sociopathic tendencies, and we know they must eventually come to light, as now back in present-day time, EVA goes to visit KEVIN in prison, where he steadfastly ignores her.
 
In her flashbacks, we see EVA and FRANKLIN have a daughter, CELIA, who is sweet and everything EVA wants in a child.  KEVIN continues to manipulate his parents, fooling his father, but only arousing his mother’s suspicions further after an accident in which young CELIA loses an eye.  
 
By the time KEVIN is in his mid-teens, he can interact with his parents on a normal level and only betrays his inner disturbed state when angrily dismissing EVA from an attempt at dinner together in a restaurant.  Not long after, EVA is called to the high school where she discovers that KEVIN has locked the gym doors shut and is killing students and staff with his high-powered crossbow.  In shock, EVA watches him driven off in a cop car, then rushes home to discover that he has also murdered CELIA and FRANKLIN.  Her life in ruins, EVA begins to live in the numb state that we have seen her in since the movie’s opening.  Two years after the tragedy, EVA visits KEVIN in prison again to find him much less cocky, much more unsure of why he committed the atrocity in the first place.  We see that it may be possible for EVA to move on in her own life.

",,,,,,,,"LOGLINE
When treachery and dark magic threaten to overwhelm Arabia, Princess Sheherazad and her fiancé, the brave Commander Kamar, must join forces with the heroes of her tales, Sinbad, Ali Baba and Aladdin, in order to overcome the dark Alchemist and bring peace to the kingdom.

COMMENTS
Sometimes fun, sometimes a bit hackneyed and drawn out, full of long action sequences that seem a bit generic.  The concept is a bit of a hook in itself– the stories of Arabian Nights come to life to aid the storyteller, and there are also monsters and large-scale battles, but the characters and the plot leave much to be desired.  E.g., we get more of a thrill from having Aladdin show up then from anything he actually contributes to the story.  Pass.

SM COMMENTS 
The pricing is really high for this 70M film from the director of SCORPION KING.  The script has exhilarating moments, and I like the concept, theoretically, but agree largely with the reader’s comments; the conceit lends itself to eagerly anticipating how they are going to work in Ali Baba, Aladdin, the genie, Sinbad, etc, but very rarely does the story live up to the promise of the premise… Family big budget action for popcorn audiences.  The numbers are so high that the mediocrity of the script make it an easy pass for all. 


SUMMARY

SHEHERAZAD, the beautiful and intelligent princess of Arabia, tells stories of SINBAD to the palace children in the days before her wedding to KAMAR, the handsome and brave commander of the Royal Guard.  During a banquet thrown by KING SULIMON, an ill omen arrives bringing the message that the ancient Alchemist, PHAROTU, is alive and plotting.  GENERAL SABUR is intrigued by the news– jealous of KAMAR’s good standing he seeks out PHAROTU and is quickly overwhelmed by the powerful will of the evil Alchemist.  PHAROTU sends SABUR back to the capital with a force of flying chimeric soldiers to kill SULIMON and take over the kingdom.

Meanwhile, KAMAR’s diplomacy mission to the MAHARAJAH had been thrown off track by a treacherous set-up of PHAROTU.  Just as they resolve their misunderstanding and the treaty, KAMAR’s falcon HORUS arrives, bearing word from SHEHERAZAD of SULIMON’s death and SABUR’s treason.

As KAMAR races back to Arabia, hijacking and then hiring a ship that belongs to an older, grizzled SINBAD, SABUR forces SHEHERAZAD to marry him.  In order to delay the consummation of the marriage, SHEHERAZAD plies SABUR with wine and stories based on KAMAR’s letters to SHEHERAZAD of his adventures as he races back to her.

A cabin boy on SINBAD’s ship is revealed to be ALI BABA, a female thief, in disguise.  When Sinbad’s ship is destroyed by a storm sent by PHAROTU, ALI BABA leads the group to a palace in the desert.  There they find a young man, ALADIN, berating a GENIE for not giving their guests proper welcome.  ALADIN and GENIE are recruited to the cause and KAMAR wishes for them all to be brought home.  They materialize just outside of the palace, where GENIE cannot enter, due to PHAROTU’s dark powers.

Sweeping up SHEHERAZADE from the executioner’s chopping block, where SABUR has sent her for her resistance, KAMAR and the heroes plunge forth into battle against PHAROTU, SABUR and their monstrous allies.  After a protracted battle, SHEHERAZADE finds the secret location of PHAROTU’s heart and stabs it, allowing SINBAD to finish off the transformed, chimeric PHAROTU while KAMAR does the same to SABUR.  KAMAR and SHEHERAZADE are married, ALI BABA and ALADDIN go off together, and SINBAD gets a fancy new ship and sets sail for more adventures.

READER COMMENTS: 
Comments:  This is a very well written script that doesn’t waste any time getting things going.  To accurately describe the plot of this movie it would take pages, there are a lot of little details that give subtle hints or mislead the audience into another direction.  The movie basically has two major locations and would be very cheap to produce.  

SM COMMENTS: 
The attachments are just middle of the road and the script falls into the same category; its not terrible - there is a bit of tension and a few smart twists and turns throughout; but the writing is sloppy, the characters flat, the dialog clunky, and the final twist just kind of lame.  I enjoyed reading it but ultimately think its pretty forgettable.    It's not exactly 'nail biting' and seems like a TV/ VIDEO movie with no real theatrical potential.  Perhaps interesting for Middle East, but for others its a definite. Like a poor man's FUNNY GAMES, mixed with bad guys that are stock recreations of the columbine killers. Pass. 

SUMMARY 
DYNAN is a young clever college student, his mom can’t afford her prescription medication and his father is always working.  He enlists the help of TAYLOR and JENNA, both unstable “indie” kids, for his big plan.  NICK, JEFF, and LUCY have never had to worry about money their entire lives.  Their fathers, JONES, NADER, and VINCENT eagerly await their kids’ arrival at Jones’s vacation home in the Adirondacks. Jones is Lucy’s father, Nader is Nick’s father, and Vincent is Jeff’s father.  Vincent hasn’t arrived at the house yet and Nader’s assistant FRANK is still there.  The kids are stopped by Jenna standing in the middle of the mountain road.  When they get out of the car Taylor shows up with a sawed off shotgun and tells them where to go. 

Cut to the basement of Nick’s father’s vacation home, where Nick, Lucy, and Jeff are all tied up and blindfolded against the wall.  Dynan calls Nick’s dad; he speaks in a southern accent. He explains that they have to transfer 1 million for each kid into a specific bank account.  The dads explain that Vincent hasn’t arrived yet but he will be there shortly.  Lucy gets anxious and shoots Jeff in the chest.  The dad’s frantically try to get the money wired as quickly as possible when Vincent arrives.  They decide not to tell him that his son has been shot for fear that he will call the cops.  Meanwhile, Nick and Lucy manage to free themselves from the rope while their kidnappers are upstairs.  When Nick was a kid he and Jeff conveniently a secret tunnel from the basement to the tool shed that he and Lucy can crawl through to safety.  When Jenna and Taylor notice that they are no longer in the basement, a chase through the woods ensues.  They are almost caught when they hide in an abandoned cabin, but in the end they escape.  

The tension in the Adirondack house builds as the dads argue about money.  Once all of the money is transferred Vincent finally finds out that his son has been shot. Dynan informs Jenna and Taylor that the money has been transferred and they need to get out of there.  The three of them pull up to a vacant gas station, Dynan reveals what is really up his sleeve.  He shoots Jenna in the head and explains to Taylor that as far as the hostages were concerned he doesn’t exist.  He shoots Taylor.  

Lucy and Nick arrive at the Adirondack house, shortly after Dynan shows up.  Nobody knows who Dynan is because they were blindfolded and he was speaking in a southern accent over the phone.  From the back of the house FRANK, Nader’s assistant recognizes Dynan as his son.  We now know the motive behind Dynan’s master plan.  He has grown up hearing his father complain about all of the money these guys throw around, he was finally going to get some for himself.  As Frank and Dynan leave the scene of the crime, Frank realizes that his son had everything to do with it.  He is not happy.

COMMENTS (Maggie):
A commercial script in the vein of MAN ON FIRE and TRAFFIC.  Not entirely original, but well written and filled with all of the essential components of a box office success – action, violence, suspense, sex appeal.  I don’t think we have seen Matthew McConaughey in a role like this before, but I think audiences will like it.  I would say my only problem with the script is that I don’t feel entirely sympathetic for the main character, as he got himself into this mess, but I’m sure McConaughey’s good looks and charm will make up for it.  I would give the script a B+ as it’s tightly written but not entirely fresh, but with the cast attachments and commercial potential, I would give the overall project an A-.  I would say it’s a strong consider for Latin America, and the Middle East, where this genre plays well.

COMMENTS (Steve): Reads like more of a character piece than an overt thriller; it’s trying to capture some of the spirit of MARIA FULL OF GRACE by putting a character through a harrowing experience; and for the most part it works.   I haven’t seen anything by the director, but his first film is highly praised, and with the cast I agree its interesting for Lat Am and Middle East, providing they don’t go crazy with the prices. This is NOT a clear cut action thriller, it’s far more of a slow burn psychological thing for the most part, as we see McConaughey’s character descend deeper and deeper into a grave he’s dug for himself. I don’t think it will work for smarthouse; not enough edge. Popcorn only. B minus tops.

SYNOPSIS:
JACK works as border control between Mexico and the states.  He’s good at his job, but you can tell this line of work is taking a toll on him, and his family.  His wife, DARLENE, replaces her loneliness with alcohol and meds, and the distance between Jack and Darlene is wearing on their relationship. 
 
JACK goes out with his co-worker CLINT to a Mexican wrestling match.  This is where Jack meets AMANDA for the first time, a young Latina, who he recognizes from crossing the border.  Their paths cross again the following day, when Jack is working the border.  Amanda offers him a bribe to let her cross, she has two small children in the back who she says need to see their family.  This is the only way she can reunite the family.  Jack gives in, and lets them cross, and she pays him 3K for it.  This starts the vicious cycle that will continue for some time.  He continues to accept bribes from her on a regular basis to bring these children across, and others who are separated from their family.
 
Darlene starts attending AA meetings to improve her behavior and her relationship with Jack.  Jack starts bringing home more and more money, and their lifestyles start to improve.  However, Jack has a thing for Amanda, and he ends up sleeping with her.  Amanda invites Jack over for dinner one night at ERNESTINA’s house.  Ernestina is Amanda’s mother-in-law.  Amanda’s husband has passed, but she still helps Ernestina run the business of shuffling immigrants through the boarder.  Amanda competes with BEN, Ernestina’s son in law, who also wants to take over the business.  It’s obvious that there is bad blood between the two, and it’s at this point that Jack realizes he is in over his head.
 
Ben starts bringing illegals through the boarder as well, and threatens Jack if he screws it up.  Jack is starting to feel the pressure, and the other officers at the boarder are starting to take notice, growing suspicious of Jack.  Clint watches on as well, he knows Jack is up to something.
 
One day, a Winnebago pulls up to Jack’s lane.  Alarms are set off at his station, as the Winnebago is strapped with smoke alarms and he is forced to investigate what’s inside.  Jack removes a panel from the Winnebago, and finds a throng of young girls bound and beaten, trapped inside the car, they are obviously going to be used for human trafficking.  Federal agents interrogate Jack, to find out if he knows anything, they tell Jack that they know he was paid off.  The driver rats out Jack and everything starts to go downhill from here.
 
Ben blames Jack for the bust, and his now out for his family.  Jack tells them to go to a family friend’s house to stay safe,  but we discover that Ben placed a tracking device in Maddy’s stuffed animal to track them down.  Ben and his posse kidnap Darlene and their son Maddy. 

Jack and Clint go on the hunt to find Darlene and Maddy.  They are being chased and shot at, Jack manages to miss the line of fire, but when Clint gets shot and killed by one of Ben’s gang bangers, Jack discovers that Clint is wired, and that he set up Jack when the feds offered him a plea bargain.  Jack must now track down Amanda, and try to find his wife and child.  When he catches up with Amanda, she admits that she set up Ben by fixing the Winnebago with smoke alarms.  She wanted to take him down, so that he wouldn’t take over the family business.  She claims that he was ruining the business by taking it to a level that it was never intended to – by smuggling young girls, fire arms, etc. 
 
Amanda leads Jack to a shanty town where Darlene and Maddy are being held hostage.  A young boy gives Jack a tip as to their location, and Jack finds his way into their hiding place to rescue them.  He leaves Amanda behind, and it’s quite obvious what might happen to her if he leaves.  Ben is looking for Jack, but ends up being shot to death by Amanda’s backup, and Jack is able to escape with Darlene and Maddy who flee to Guatemala.

COMMENTS 
 
Mediocre film that is trying to play like a modern day Graham Greene story;  I didn’t realize until halfway through that it was a spy thriller, but by then I had almost completely lost interest.  There are a lot of commercial aspects, intrigue, sex, and a bit of action at the end; but man… this story really dragged.  Lime is the perfect archetype for a captivating spy character, but he only had one or two interesting moments for me (his scene at the party where he offended Slim being the primary one). Similarly, Emile’s SOLDIER was also a bit of a dullard, and was so easily manipulated at the end that I lost any sympathy. Pass. 
 
SUMMARY 
 
LIME, an international man with several passports, flashes a French one and drives into Tangier.  JAMES, a soldier on leave, swims in the Riviera, and has one week till his return to the services. 
 
 On a ferry, James invites young TUFFY, a pretty girl, to have a beer with him.  The girl winds up hustling him, snatching several hundred bucks and leaving him penniless. DEAN (the narrator of the story) comes and calms him down, helps stop James from getting arrested and buys him a beer; DEAN convinces James to come join him at a party and play some Spanish music. 
 
DEAN goes to a party and finds LIME, and his old friend, the gorgeous woman SLIM who takes an instant disliking to Lime. “Do NOT invite that horrid man.” 
 
At the party; JAMES plays with the band and SLIM becomes smitten; she winds up sleeping with him and inviting him to stay the week in her  (gay) husband FAISAL’s pool house. 
 
After the week, Slim tries to convince him not to return. “life is too short to die for strangers.” 
 
LIME is working for the CIA and doing surveillance of FAISAI.  SLIM is shocked when she is served divorce papers; FAISAL assures JAMES that he is not the reason for the divorce;  JAMES gets into a fight with a local thug and gets arrested. 
 
LIME visits JAMES In jail; “you’re not AWOL, you’re a deserter in time of war.” It’s a crime that still carries a death penalty.  “Fuck fuck fucker fucked.” 
 
LIME tells JAMES that FAISAL is an A List terror suspect and forces James to start working for the CIA. James goes back to the house and Slim slaps him, assuming he’d been out sleeping with another woman. She throws him on the bed and has sex with him. 
 
JAMES breaks into Faisal’s safe and photographs secret documents and turns them over to LIME. 
 
LIME tells James that Faisal is an intergral part of the terrorist infrastructure and that he’s planning to fire a rocket and screw up the straight of Gibraltar.  Slim catches James riffling through the safe and throws him out of the house; LIME tells him he’s failed the mission and is going back to the stockade. James tells him that he thinks he can kill Faisal. Lime agrees to the plan and promises to get James out of Tangier. James kills Faisal and vomits out of guilt; but on the getaway he realizes he’s been double crossed and flees… Lime finds him on a ferry to Spain and stabs him, but James survives and kills Lime. 
 
Dean kills james and finds Lime’s car on the ferry; he finds secret papers; Lime was behind everything/ forging divorce papers to convince Slim to hire him to kill Faisal…

A pair of hot shot American doctors head to South Africa for the toughest internship in the world: battling AIDS in the gang run slums of Jo-Berg.


COMMENTS

A medical thriller that played like a cross between the American TV show E.R.,  CITY OF GOD & TOP GUN, the drama is ramped up at the outset and doesn’t let up until the bloody climax.  The dialog and characters are very simplistic and one dimensional – DAVID, the hotshot, predictably suffers some setbacks because of his arrogance, but winds up winning the hard earned respect of his surly mentor DR. ELTON (who himself is the subject of a predictable character arc, being used as a red herring in the early minutes until his motives are revealed to be quite honorable).  The ending was irksome, ELTON shoots the Gang Leader, but manages to stave off his own execution by insisting that he’s the only one capable of saving said gang leader’s life – a moment that felt entirely implausible for a plethora of reasons (For one, does appealing to trigger happy gang members ever work? Secondly, the writer spent the whole movie proving that David is a great doctor, couldn’t he have saved the Gangster?) Clunky dialog, an afterthought love interest and the aforementioned egregious showdown hampered what could have been both an exciting and intelligent script.  Instead, it’s just exciting. 

SUMMARY

DAVID & LOREN, two young doctors from Johns Hopkins head to South Africa to battle AIDS in “Bara” hospital, one of the largest hospitals in the world.  “Hell, maybe we’ll even cure the thing.” 

After a brutally long flight, the head doctor ELTON puts the two young doctors to work immediately. David is shocked by his first patient – a pregnant teenager dying of AIDS.  After helping her give birth he is immediately shuttled to another bed, then another and another.  When David finds out that the hospital is running low on lydocaine, he is led on an eye opening field trip by ELTON.  Elton meets the drug supply truck, barely fending off gangster BARTHELME and his henchmen and nearly getting DAVID killed in the process.  Realizing that the residency will easily be the hardest two years of his life, David begins counting down the days until his commitment expires.  717, 716, etc.

In a rare moment of leisure, David is wined and dined at DINESON’s mansion: DINESON is from the large corporation MAYER who are behind cutting edge anti Aids drugs.  DINESON tells David that he suspects the doctor is stealing the drugs and selling them on the black market. “We have reason to believe Dr. Elton is responsible.” 

After the newly confident and rebellious David insists on saving a young boy Elton deemed inoperable, Elton shows him the “morning’s dead” a group of patients who died while David was heroically saving the one boy.  Elton insists that in Jo-Berg, the life of one must be sacrificed for the greater good. 

Loren, meanwhile, has trouble adjusting to the strenuous residency, and after only one week, transfers to a cushier lab. David, stays on, earning the respect of his nurse ANLI, if not the tough shelled Elton.  David and Anli grow close and wind up sparking a romantic relationship.  

David accuses Elton of stealing the AIDS drugs, but is even more enraged by the Doctor’s explanation: the Doctor hasn’t been administering the drugs at all, they are all locked in a medical supply cabinet.   Irate, David reports this info to DINESON. 

David finally earns Elton’s respect by running a successful post op ward.  Just as the two doctors are beginning to work together well, David finds out that Dinerstein is planning to fire Elton.  David also finds out that the reason Elton has been withholding the drugs is because they were killing Aids patients.  

The two doctor’s problems pale in comparison to the larger threat: a full fledged gang war has broken out.  Hundreds and hundreds of people flood into the emergency room and Elton & the others struggle to administer to everyone.  Barthelme storms into the ER and nearly kills David for trying to protect a rival gang member.  Loren arrives at the ER: gang members attacked him in his hospital.  David is given a brutal choice: try for hours to save his best friend or save dozens of others.  Loren dies. 

In the early hours of the morning, TOM, an E.R. doc, and ANLI take ambulances into the ghettos to round up more wounded civilians, but the ambulance is attacked.  Tom is killed.  David and Elton head out of the hospital to rescue them, returning with Anli & ZAC – a gang leader.  Barthelme stops the doctors and tries to kill David, but Elton shoots Barthelme. “I shot your boss, and I’m the only one who can save him.” 

David manages to save Elton’s job and pledges to continue working in Jo-Berg.

There are a lot of good elements to this script; the writing is surprisingly powerful, but the structure is quite a slog to get through and I, personally, would NEVER want to watch a film like this; it’s literally a series of painful memories being experienced by a dying Iraqi war veteran; she is plagued and tormented by guilt about her relationship with her parents, her husband, and mainly her daughter, and she’s also plagued by guilt about her role in the war, and the incident she was involved in that led to the death of her comrades… and through a series of hallucinations, flashbacks and memories, she manages to come to a certain peace with the life she led.  This COULD be the type of film that wins awards; if the direction and performances are great… but that’s best case scenario; its risky because its definitely very arthouse in its structure and appeal; but I don’t know that its well done enough to draw smarter euro audiences. For Middle East its particularly tricky; this is not a mainstream picture, and you’d be buying it based on Swank’s cache alone. 
 
SUMMARY
Please note; this is a very  uniquely structured, almost stream of consciousness type script that flashes backwards and forwards throughout. I tried to pinpoint the highlights and most important scenes in order. 
 
RACHEL, is trapped in a small cell in Karbala.  Her captor insists she beg allah for forgiveness. 
 
FB RACHEL is a heli pilot; she’s sleeping with her copilot, a married soldier.  In VO she talks about the regrets of her life (presumably in a flash, before a BULLET hits her chopper).  The montage culminates with a BANG and RACHEL jerks awake; she’s in a plane, flying into Minnesota. 
 
Rachel is met at the airport by her husband DAN and her 16 year old daughter CLAIRE; and by a bunch of overzealous reporters, “how does it feel to be the first female facing court martial for cowardice?”  Rachel seemingly starts to hallucinate a memory of smoking a cigarette in the car; SMASH CUT TO : she’s on a hospital bed. “It’s not how it was! I wasn’t that much of a jerk!” she’s bleeding from her chest… CUT TO - - that was a dream. She’s in bed, at home, thrashing around and DAN has to restrain her; and gets punched in the face for his trouble. “Sorry, post traumatic stress,” she laments. 
 
Someone paints “terrorist” on Rachel’s door. Rachel is concerned and thinks Claire is dating her Arabic piano tutor. 
 
FB – Rachel in Karbala; taking fire in the chopper / / Rachel in a hospital bed, being examined by a doctor // 
 
Present: Rachel gets a weird, disconcerting phone call, and begins to feel like a stranger in her own home. 
 
Hallucinations and intercutting narratives accelarate; RACHEL is undergoing surgery / is in captivity under missile bombardment / is in her kitchen  / is in her court martial hearing / is shot in the stomach and lying on a strange floor.
 
Rachel sees herself on the operating table, and she realizes she’s dying; she even sees the “tunnel of light.” She cries out for help; trying to get her own pulse restarted… to no avail. The doctor pronounces her time of death… she winds up in space, where she sees a vision of her father, who tells her that humans have no real connection to each other. 
 
Rachel finds herself running to her daughter CLARA’s piano audition but just as quickly she finds herself back in her Iraqi dungeon, being interrogated by her Iraqi captor.   “Why did you lower your gun?” he asks her. 
 
Rachel’s trial: She tells at the tribunal judge. 

Hospital: Clara calls DAN: “mom’s been shot!”  The doctors start discussing which organs of hers are still okay for donation. 
 
Rachels dreams that she and Clara walk by the lake; Rachel’s life literally passing before her eyes; their clothing changing rapidly, through every wardrobe they’ve ever owned…  they talk about finding a connection, but also they argue; despite the fact that Clara is merely a figment of Rachel’s imaginaion.  “In this case, I am you, and you’re still fucking fighting with me!!!” 
 
Rachel remembers taking Clara to a karate dojo, arguing about Clara’s new “arab” boyfriend, and punching Clara in the face, giving her daughter a bloody nose. 
 
Joseph, who died in the chopper crash, was married to MABEL; who accosts RACHEL after the hearing; “what was it like in his last two days!” 
 
Rachel visits her mother in a nursing home, but her mother doesn’t remember her. 
 
Rachel sees her husband working with a new, beautiful associate, JUDY; Rachel suspects he may be playing around. 
 
In Iraq; Rachel sleeps with Joseph.  “this is a dirty country. Dust all over everything.” 
 
Rachel meets some teens and smokes pot with them; she gets home stoned and tries to reconcile with Clara; but manages to only make things worse. 
 
Meanwhile; Clara is being forced to decide whether or not to allow the doctor to donate Rachel’s organs. 
 
Rachel pays MABEL a visit and the woman unloads like a banshee, “tell me what his cock felt like! Kiss me, fuck me like him!!!” 
 
Rachel, Joseph and the other soldiers lie in the wreckage of the helicopter as an angry mob of Iraqi’s approach. Joseph opens fire, killing a young boy. (A boy who has been plaguing Rachel’s visions.)  Rachel demands they put down their guns. 
 
Clara sleeps with her boyfriend SHAHROOZ; Dan sleeps with Judy, Rachel recalls sleeping with Dan for the first time. 
 
Rachels’ IRAQI interrogator praises her for putting down her gun and promises to let her go. 
 
The military tribunal exonerates her.  Rachel realizes she’s dying. “these memories are all I have.” 
 
RoAs her heart is taken out for donation, Rachel speeds through images of her loved ones; resolving her disputes and finally settling into a peaceful death.

GENRE: Drama
READER: Steven Murphy

LOGLINE

A middle aged poet Blake's story growing up with his father, accepting his father’s death and coming to grips with his past while dealing with his own fatherhood.

COMMENTS

A moving story filled with a lot of wonderfully conflicting emotions, that unfortunately, is not remarkably original.  Blake’s character comes across very unlikeably, but Arthur is a wonderful creation, funny and flawed and bitter till the moment he dies.  Anand Tucker has had success in the past, but I didn’t love Shopgirl.  I do not think this script with these attachments are a prebuy, and recommend waiting till rough cut to see if the director can make a film that is complex and moving rather than weepy and morose.  


SUMMARY  Flashbacks in Italics

1959 - BLAKE, a shy young boy, is mortified by his outrageous father, the penny pinching doctor ARTHUR.   Arthur takes the to a motor raceway but gets stuck in traffic.   Bitter about missing the first race, Arthur pulls into the oncoming lane and speeds pass the queu, holding up a stethoscope and pretending that he’s on a medical emergency.  Blake slinks down in the backseat, hiding his face.

January 1989 – Blake wins a prestigious award for poetry, but his crotchety father still discounts his profession.  Blake yearns for his father’s approval, hoping merely for the old man to say “well done.”  Nevertheless, Blake is forced to chuckle when he sees his father regaling Salmon Rushdie with one of his stories.

December 1989 – 
Blake’s house is chaotic, his young child running rampant.  Blake is interrupted by an urgent phone call from his mother KIM, calling to tell him that Arthur is very near death.

Six Weeks Earlier – 
Arthur comes to visit Blake in his new home and complains about the fact that Blake wasted money hiring a moving company.  Arthur insults Blake’s profession and laments the fact that his son didn’t follow in his footsteps and become a doctor.  Arthur confesses that he’s going into the hospital because he’s been having “tummy pains,” but insists that its nothing to worry about.  He helps Blake hang a chandelier in the living room.   Blake visits his father in the hospital.  The doctor tells Blake that Arthur is terminal.  Arthur and Kim completely ignore the diagnosis and act as if all is well.  Arthur sees a woman name BEATY in the hospital, and remembers being suspicious that his father had been having an affair with her.

December 1989
Blake arrives and finds his father in bed, looking like he’s at deaths door.  Blake temporarily moves into his childhood room and begins reminiscing about his childhood- remembering a:

1962 Camping trip he and his father went on.  Arthur forgot to bring tent poles and a rainstorm wound up soaking the tent.  Arthur spent most of the time in the pub, and Blake secretly overhears his father talking dirty to a woman (not his mother) on the telephone.  As a child, he begins to suspect that his father is sleeping with Beaty, and even suspects ARTHUR may be the father of Beaty’s daughter JOSIE.

Christmas 1963 – At a family Christmas party, Blake tries to flirt with his family maid SANDRA, a beautiful 18 year old scot.  She shoots him down.  Arthur gets drunk and dances with Beaty in front of Kim.  Kim sneaks off to her room and lies down.  Blake tries to console her, but later hears his mother and father fighting.  

1968 – Blake and his family holiday at a ski resort.  When Arthur begins hitting on a young girl that Blake had his eye on, the teen (who’d had a bit too much to drink) erupts and accuses his father of having an affair.  Arthur cuts off the conversation “I have no idea what you’re talking about.”   Upon returning from the trip, Blake and Sandra begin sleeping together.

Present day – Arthur is getting worse and worse, actually beginning to vomit up his own excrement (a terminal sign).   He dies.  Kim gets into bed and stays next to Arthur’s corpse all night.   In the morning they call the mortician.  Blake visits Sandra and tries to seduce her, but they simply wind up cuddling and reminiscing.  Beaty comes to the funeral and Blake confronts her, asking if she had an affair with Arthuer, asking if Josie is his sister.  Beaty refuses to tell  him. Blake thinks back about the day six months earlier that his father helped him hang the chandelier.  It was the last time he saw his father before the man got sick.

Three Lawrences are LAR; a heroic small town cop; his father, LARRY, a penniless junky, and grandfather LARRY, a mysterious vagabond who acts like a crazed prophet. 
 
COMMENTS 
The big twist comes near the end when we realize that the three Larry’s are the same person at different stages of his life; if I were more curious I’d reread the script because the logic of the writing seems severely flawed and I think I could punch holes in the structure if I were so inclined; as it stands, the “twist” didn’t really pack an emotional punch and basically made me feel confused and misled.  (Who the hell is Larry’s dad, then, after all?)  
 
Regardless, the scenes are sloppy, dialog poor, emotions overwrought. Solid pass; not a strong genre for the middle east and the heavy Christian imagery should help that decision. If they pitch this as action packed they are misconstruing the plot. 
 
SUMMARY (half) 
LAR tries to overcome shame for the sins of his junky father LARRY by doing his best to be not only a cop but a hero; while literally fishing a young girl from certain death in raging rapids he finds a dead body of a local young woman.  The investigation begins slowly, and LAR is troubled by personal problems; his father LARRY is the town shame, a junky. LARRY’s lover SALLY gets fed up with him, and after he slaps and bruises her, she leaves him for good.  He tries to turn over a new life, but nobody believes him, and everyone claims they’ve heard it before. 
 
Meanwhile, an anthropology student JOSH heads into the mountains to interview the crazed old man, LAWRENCE who spouts religious terminology and drunks his own homemade moonshine. Lawrence has a checkered past and bristles when JOSH asks him about a murder he was accused of years ago. 
 
LARRY gets crazed; desperate and in withdrawal he tries to kill himself but SALLY has stolen the bullets from his gun. He robs and stabs a local PRIEST and gets arrested holding a bloody knife… but the cops arrest him for killing SALLY. “This is a fucking joke right?” Sally has been killed, and sliced to bits.  
 
The investigators accuse Larry of killing Sally the “same way” that Lawrence allegedly killed his victims. 
 
Josh pulls a gun on Lawrence; “did you kill my mother?” “No son,” Lawrence replies. “I never did her any good, but I didn’t kill her.” 
 
A mudslide during a storm destroys Lar’s house.  His wife and child die.  
 
The priest visits LARRY in the hospital and tells LARRY the story of LAR’s family dying; at which point we realize LAR’s life has been a flashback… and LAWRENCE has been a flash forward.. LAR, LARRY and LAWRENCE are ALL the same person. 
 
LAWRENCE; present day, realizes that one of the cops has been the serial killer behind every one of the murders.

LOGLINE 
A young couple drives to Niagara Falls for their honeymoon.  While the bride fantasizes about the perfect romantic getaway, the groom plans to escape both his parole and his marriage, by fleeing across the border to Canada.


SUMMARY 
	A young couple prepares for their wedding in a small Kentucky town.  CAMILLE FOSTER, the young bride-to-be, obsesses over her wedding gown and daydreams about her honeymoon in Niagara Falls.  SILAS PARKER, her groom, is a rebel without a clue.  Before the wedding, he speaks with his parole officer, RAYMOND FOSTER (also CAMILLE’s uncle).  RAYMOND tries to drill it into SILAS’s head that he’d better not screw up again, now that he’s out of jail and has found a good woman.  He is a very nice man, though, and truly believes that SILAS has a good heart beneath all the tattoos.
	In a conversation with CAMILLE, though, RAYMOND warns her that SILAS is not allowed to leave Kentucky, even for the honeymoon.  She ignores her uncle’s stern warning, and unknowingly manages to pique SILAS’s interest in the idea when she mentions the Falls’ proximity to Canada.  Other than this, SILAS shows minimal interest in anything CAMILLE has to say.  In fact, during the wedding reception, SILAS complains to the preacher about how much his bride talks.  He can’t stand it.  One gets the sense that SILAS may be with this girl because it endears him to his parole officer, RAYMOND.  However, it is clear that CAMILLE is head over heels in love with SILAS.
	En route to Niagara Falls, the couple stops at a small truck stop to gas up SILAS’s Harley.  While CAMILLE chats with a talkative stranger, COWBOY BOB, SILAS flees about a half-mile down the road.  He throws a fit, ripping the wedding streamers off his bike, but he returns to CAMILLE.  CAMILLE asks if he loves her, to which he replies “No.  Never have.”  Though this breaks CAMILLE’s heart, she stays positive and is determined to build a loving relationship.  The two hop back on the Harley and head toward Niagara.
	A little ways down the road, though, CAMILLE’s wedding band slides off.  In the ensuing confusion, the two are hit by a truck and knocked off the road.  SILAS regains consciousness first and, thinking CAMILLE is dead, goes to the nearest house to phone the police.  Since he is covered in blood, the residents of the house mistake him for a murderer/robber, and hand over all of their money.  Happy to have their money, he decides not to make the call.  He returns to the bike and CAMILLE has come to.
	Happy to see that she is alive, SILAS actually shows CAMILLE some affection.  CAMILLE is very happy to see this, and remains 100% positive about the situation, even though she is bleeding from the head and probably elsewhere.  Some teenagers driving a hearse see the distressed couple and offer them a ride and a meal.  They drive to the diner, where CAMILLE eats several steaks and baked potatos.  SILAS and the BUSBOY each point out to her that she is still bleeding from the ear, but all CAMILLE will talk about is Niagara Falls.  She is determined.
	The following morning, CAMILLE appears dead…again.  She eventually wakes with a coughing fit, creeping SILAS out a bit.  She’s gotten thinner and really looks awful.  The purple bruise around her neck, from the accident, has grown to encompass more of her torso.  Her hair is falling out.  
	Since their Harley is busted, SILAS decides to use a credit card out of the stolen wallet to book the honeymoon suite at a fancy hotel.	 Meanwhile, SHERIFF BILL STEINER and RAYMOND FOSTER are hot on the trail of SILAS, after the SHERIFF received a phone call from the family SILAS robbed.  The paper trail leads them to the young couple’s Ohio hotel room.    
	In the hotel room, SILAS is having flashbacks to the night of the accident…he’s having some sort of epiphany: CAMILLE is DEAD….[Yep, they went there.  This girl is a walking corpse.]  SILAS goes out to the pool to tell CAMILLE that she is dead, but she is distracted by a blue horse…the same blue horse she has always had dreams about.  Turns out the horse belongs to COWBOY BOB, who runs a “Living Carousel” with four creepy, spray-painted horses.  SILAS confides in BOB that CAMILLE is dead and enlists his help in robbing a funeral home.  Back at the room, SILAS explains to his girl that she is dead, but everything is going to be all right.  He gives her a wig and starts to treat her body with formaldehyde.  Though she is dead, CAMILLE stays remarkably positive.
	However, the cops are about to barge into the couple’s hotel room.  So, SILAS has CAMILLE play dead on the floor, while he climbs down the fire escape outside.  The cops are in shock at the gruesome “murder scene,” and immediately put CAMILLE on a gurney.  SILAS meets CAMILLE as they descend in the hotel elevator, and she jumps off the gurney and into his arms.  They escape the gunfire of the police to the haven of COWBOY BOB’s horse trailer.  They drive off into the night.  CAMILLE has a bullet hole right through her shoulder and is not even bleeding, but she is still pretty confident that she’ll make a full recovery from whatever it is that’s ailing her.
	COWBOY BOB stops in western Pennsylvania for a carnival.  No one really likes his creepy painted horse carousel.  Everyone comments on the blue horse, Maggie, looking pretty close to death.  The whole town is excited for the Strawberry Ball.  Since CAMILLE has finally acknowledged that her appearance is getting a bit pale and creepy, she has COWBOY BOB spraypaint her, transforming her into a “Technicolor version of herself.”  At the dance, SILAS and CAMILLE hold one another tenderly and, oh my God, SILAS kisses the Technicolor Dead Girl!  Ahh, love…it knows no boundaries.  But of course, the moment is ruined when CAMILLE’s bones start to crackle, and her ring finger falls off.  CAMILLE is very upset.
	At this time, someone recognizes SILAS from his picture in the paper, and the police attempt to arrest him.  COWBOY BOB saves the day once again, though, and the newlyweds flee in his trailer.  As soon as they get away, though, COWBOY BOB decides he needs a new start in life, and he sets his painted horses free.  He gives the kids the keys to his truck and tells them he’s staying behind.  So, they continue on to their destiny: Niagara Falls.  At the falls, CAMILLE is extremely happy.  The falls are everything she’s dreamed of for twenty years.  While on a boat next to the falls, SILAS tries to find someone to take their picture.  He returns to CAMILLE only to find that she has disappeared.  He looks over the railing but does not see her.  She must have gone over the falls!  He cries.
	With his girl officially gone, though, SILAS realizes that he needs to carry out his original plan.  He heads for the border.  Just then RAYMOND and SHERIFF STEINER show up, with a whole bunch of cops in tow.  They order SILAS to surrender himself.  He is just about to, when CAMILLE miraculously appears.  Everyone is shocked.  Then, MAGGIE the blue horse shows up as well!  The couple jumps onto the horse, declares their love for one another, and rides the horse over the falls.  THEN, the falls go silent and RICE rains down from the sky.  I swear to you I didn’t make that part up.   
	  
	

COMMENTS

 	This script could be described as Death Becomes Her meets Just Married.  That would be giving it a bit too much credit, though.  This is a film about a girl so obsessed with getting to Niagara Falls on her honeymoon, that even DEATH won’t stop her.  I admit, it’s a pretty decent concept for a black comedy.  However, I think the only time I laughed was during the scene where an old man catches Silas trying to steal his truck and says, “Son, in my day, a man didn’t steal another man’s mode of transportation… It just wasn’t done.”   If that’s the funniest line in your movie, you are officially in trouble.
	The attempts at humorous dialogue pretty much amount to a good 20-30 jokes about how bad Camille begins to smell.  The visual/physical comedy of her hair falling out and her skin getting discolored could be funny at first, but I’m sure would become merely creepy and gross at some point during the 60 minutes or so of screen time in which Camille is dead.  
	Also, the love story is pretty awful.  Silas clearly has no interest at all in Camille at first.  He especially can’t stand how much she talks.  He marries her because it will help him circumvent the justice system.  Yet somehow, after Camille dies and begins to literally decompose before his eyes, he falls in love with her.  Nothing in her personality changes, and she is freaking DEAD!  And…he…falls…in…love…with…her.   
	I don’t see any reason why this film would perform well overseas.  There are no stars, it’s too dark for most people, it’s just plain not funny, and it often makes little to no sense.

Liberace’s lover of five years reveals all about the performer, from his generosity to his insecurity to his secrecy regarding his homosexuality.

COMMENTS - MW
Steven Soderbergh intends to make this a dark comedy. Well, I do see dark, but no comedy. Liberace is neither interesting nor famous enough to carry a mediocre story/script. There is no love in this script. Just greed, selfishness, loneliness and opportunism. The cast is surely not going to add humor to it. I can't imagine a straighter cast in gay roles. With nobody to root for, and no laughs, I see no reason to pre-buy. PASS

SUMMARY
In 1987 Los Angeles, SCOTT THORSON (late 20s) meets with a GHOST WRITER (whose face we don’t see) to tell all about his relationship with LIBERACE in order to clear his name… and for money, which Scott desperately needs. Scott is barred from Liberace’s funeral, which he feels is disappointingly modest and not fitting for the showman at all. He recalls how he met Liberace a decade earlier when he was a teen. He attends a Vegas show and is amazed at Liberace’s talent and rapport with the crowd (almost all middle-aged ladies who seem oblivious to his flamboyancy) during his boogie woogie routine. Liberace’s protégé JERRY makes an appearance as well. Through a friend’s friend, Scott is introduced to Liberace who openly admires him. Jerry ignores him. Liberace invites Scott to his ridiculously extravagant mansion and gives him his private phone number, ostensibly for medicine for his dog since Scott works with a vet.

After returning to LA, Scott eventually calls and Liberace flies him out to Vegas to hand-deliver the medicine. After a show, they wind up in a hot tub together where Liberace pours his heart out to Scott about his disappointments with protégé-turned-monster Jerry, and although Scott (bisexual) isn’t particularly attracted to Liberace, the man’s loneliness strikes a chord in him. Liberace offers to hire him as a secretary/confidante with unspoken benefits, and Scott leaves his foster family to move in with Liberace. While Scott replaces Jerry in Liberace’s act, Liberace’s agent SEYMOUR HELLER gets Jerry out of the picture with a bribe to hold his tongue about the showman’s sexuality. Scott and Liberace grow ever closer, spending time in Scott’s smaller Vegas home (purchased by Liberace) where Liberace plays the housewife and tells him all about his past – giving up classical music because he knew his career in it wouldn’t be dazzling, his struggle with homosexuality, and being a devout Catholic despite being gay. When he tells Scott he loves him, the inexperienced Scott feels that he loves Liberace too. 

A couple years later, they’re still together but getting older and fatter. Liberace is shocked by his aged appearance on TV and insists they get plastic surgery. The sketchy Dr. STARTZ gives Liberace a facelift and puts Scott on a diet that consists of pharmaceutical cocaine, beginning Scott’s perpetual drug addiction. Liberace also has Startz re-do Scott’s face in his own likeness. He even tries to adopt Scott, although later the documentation is nowhere to be found. Despite this makeover, the two lovers begin arguing as Scott continues to take drugs (now supplied by a MR. Y, an LA-based gay nightclub owner) and Liberace’s eyes begin to wander towards younger men like 18-year-old CARY JAMES, part of Liberace’s opening act. Scott realizes he is being treated the way Jerry was before Liberace cut him off with Seymour’s help. 

When Scott’s foster mother passes away, Liberace seems genuinely sorry and offers to fly him to the funeral in a private plane. But upon his return to Vegas, Scott learns that Liberace had taken up with Cary during his absence. Scott returns to LA in a snit and lodges in Liberace’s Hollywood penthouse, expecting an apology. Instead, Liberace gives him an ultimatum (via Seymour) to get out of the penthouse before he arrives himself for a performance at the Academy Awards ceremony. Seymour and his thugs try to remove Scott after a wild chase around the penthouse, and Seymour advises him not to contact Liberace or return to Vegas. Scott begins his lawsuits, threatening to expose Liberace’s lifestyle, but he ends up with minor settlements since his drug habits make him a poor plaintiff. Scott tries to go to the tabloids with his story, but Liberace’s press team (much experienced in refuting gay accusations) make him out to look like a street hustling liar. 

Scott gives up his suits and becomes a postal worker, when out of the blue, a sick Liberace calls to ask him if he’s in good health. Scott realizes Liberace has AIDS and he was worried he may have infected Scott. At Liberace’s invitation, Scott visits his sickbed in Vegas where the dying showman asks for his discretion (he doesn’t want to be remembered as a queen) and admits their relationship made him happiest. When Liberace dies, an autopsy that Seymour tries to prevent reveals that he died of AIDS. Back in the present, the Ghost Writer arrives at Scott’s apartment only to find it empty. Supertitles tell us that Scott was placed in the Witness Protection Program as a key witness to the Wonderland murders. The film ends with the fabulous “funeral” that Scott had envisioned for Liberace, with the showman himself rising from the dead out of a rhinestone sarcophagus to perform one last finale.

",,,,,,,"LOGLINE
An investment banker survives a disaster at sea, but loses his entire memory and seemingly his entire personality; he also starts seeing mysterious visions and getting attacked by strangers… 

COMMENTS 
Pretty early on in the script it became clear that the writers have decided to keep the audience off balance by introducing twist after twist, many of them in the vein of M. Night Shyamalan, but unfortunately, most of them were either baffling or completely predictable, and indeed , it didn’t take long to realize that CRAIG himself was an alien.  The love story between Craig and Abby is perhaps the only redeeming aspect, but its more of an afterthought; a handful of action sequences are almost entirely buried by flashback after flashback. 
Pass. 

SUMMARY
An investment banker, “a hunter” as he fancies himself, CRAIG takes a yachting trip with his pal JULES and two bimboish girls. A meteor shower disrupts their serenity, and CRAIG is the only survivor. 

After the accident, Craig loses his memory. He takes a job as a zookeeper; he has trouble staying warm and he lives in a shabby apartment with a nice girlfriend ABBY. “I have enough memories for both of us.” 

Strange things begin happening around him; He sees a weird looking lizard man on a subway… a bum that disappears almost instantly. He sees a black woman screaming that her husband isn’t her husband… “it’ looks like him, but its not him!” and he sees a hitchhiker standing in two different places at the same time. 

His hallucinations intensify one night at the zoo; he sees a little girl run into a gorilla enclosure; heroically he jumps into the cage to save her and nearly gets killed. She tells him “he has to remember.” Zoo handlers tranquilize the gorillas and save Craig’s life.  The girl disappears and the handlers, as well as his friend and coworker Zolan, all think Craig has lost his mind. 

Craig meets a pilot TROY, who had flown the plane that rescued Craig; TROY looks like a bum and he’s edgy and nervous; he tells Craig that “they” are after him and tells him that everyone else on the flight has been killed.  TROY gets interrupted during the clandestine meeting and gets chased; he winds up getting thrown into the propellers of the Staten Island ferry by an unseen assailant… Craig is shocked, but even further shocked when Troy reappears from the dead. 

Things start falling apart around him; Craig rushes to the office of his psychiatrist, desperately looking for help. DR RUBIN puts him under hypnosis, but Craig wakes up and has no idea what happened.  He finds out later that the doctor’s assistant was KILLED. 

He realizes that the mysterious people around him are shape shifting aliens; they are imploring him to “remember” something that happened when he was in the water during his disaster. He confesses to ABBY, but she winds up being a government agent; in fact, everyone Craig knows, his friend ZORAN, his Doctor, his mother, they are all government agents. They bring Craig to a strange holding pen full of aliens and Craig realizes that HE is an alien…  He is not Craig at all; he is a shape shifting alien who landed and then turned into Craig; the government kidnapped him and is trying to train him to act like a human so they can use him as a spy and help them figure out what it is that the Aliens actually want.   Craig starts realizing his powers and with ABBY’s help, he breaks out of the facility and goes on the run. 

It is clear Abby has fallen for him, despite the fact that he’s an alien… but Craig is doomed to be on the run forever.

",,,,,,,,"COMMENTS:
Steve's comments: The script is very poor; the characters are all quite silly and the plot is slow and not extremely compelling.  It's a movie about three people with problems; one is melting, one is turning into water (and drips all over the place) and the third is suicidal. They go on a strange road trip to find a doctor, and are being chased by a mysterious villain. Besides finding out about their strange illnesses, nothing much happens, plot wise; there's no action, no tension, and the set up seems sillier and sillier the longer the script goes; the characters spend most of the time arguing with each other in a really childish fashion, making fun of each other for   melting/ being suicidal, etc...   The cast isnt that great, I think   Nick Stahl in particular is a pretty unappealing actor and certainly not a big star. This is not the next Twilight. I advise you pass on it.

Parallel stories of the bond of female friendship told between 2 generations - past and present, and how their love is stronger than any other.  Both stories are about a rich girl who befriends a poor girl and how they ultimately switch stations in life.

COMMENTS
Very well-written, depicts certain hardships of being a woman in China, where the poorer woman often has more freedom and choice than the wealthy woman.  It actually addresses some aspects of female life that we do not often see in Chinese films.

Story told in the 1800s, 1990s and present, which is somewhat of a  schematic set up, though it makes this feel epic.

Definitely a woman's film - has the prerequisite sadness and also lovely female bonding moments. Director and actresses, plus a Fox Searchlight domestic release, give it a lot of weight.  Likely good for any buyers who do well with Chinese costume dramas.

TITLE: An Invisible Sign of My Own
DIRECTOR: Marilyn Agrelo
WRITER: Mark Ellis, Pam Falk
CAST: Jessica Alba
STATUS: In Development
GENRE: Drama
READER: Steven Murphy

LOGLINE

A young women with two major preoccupations; numbers and her father’s mortality; takes a job as a math teacher where she puts her love of figures to work opening children’s minds while finally beginning to live her own life rather than live in constant trepidation of her father’s impending demise. 


COMMENTS

Frankly, I don’t think Jessica Alba is right for this part.  I’ve never really seen her show any sign of dramatic range, and this is a nuanced role that seems more suited for a truly indie type actor, and the image of Alba as a math obsessed neurotic is too similar to the the type of film where an absurdly hot girl throws on glasses and pretends to be a rocket scientist; it’s just incongruous and tough to believe.   My feelings about the script wavered throughout, a lot of the numerical obsession and debilitating neuroses seemed trite and forced, but some of the oddball quirkiness had charm.  Overall though, the character seems contrived and with Alba in the lead role, I think this is going to wind up being poor.  


SUMMARY

“I don’t know when it happened exactly, but dad got quieter and something started to fade in his eyes.”  MONA, 10, loves her father, a bright, optimistic man, a dermatologist and former track star, but when her father starts showing signs of a mysterious malady, her entire life is thrown into upheaval, and she loses all her drive and optimism, decided stubbornly to begin her “career as a quitter.” She refuses to let herself enjoy any of the lighter moments of life, quits eating dessert, quits flipping through atlases, quitting running track (despite possessing quite a skill for it) and quits having relationships with boys.  “The only thing I loved but never quit was math.” 

When Mona turns 22 her mother kicks her out of the house and forces her to take a job at the local elementary school as a math teacher, despite the fact that Mona doesn’t possess the necessary qualifications. Mona is reluctant to leave her father, but her mother assures her that if anything happens to him she’ll leave a message on Mona’s answering machine. 

Mona’s first foray into the classroom is tough, the first and second graders show no interest in her mathematical decorations, but bright spots come in the form of a curious and somewhat well behaved third grade class, and a cute science teacher named BEN SMITH who struggles to strike up conversation with the shy Mona. 
Mona also develops a kinship with a young girl named LISA “my favorite number is a billion” who’s mother is suffering from eye cancer. 

On her birthday, MONA and her parents go out to eat.  When they run into BEN, Mona’s MOM eagerly strikes up conversation, seeing potential for her daughter to find a suitor, but MONA, awkward as ever, runs off to the hardware store run by her kindred spirit/ neighbor MR. JONES.  Mr. Jones is a former math teacher at the same school, and MONA’s parent’s next door neighbor.  Mr. Jones wears necklaces with numbers on them that indicate his mood, if he wears a 9 he’s relatively unhappy, a 20 means he’s happy, etc.  MONA idolized him as a young girl, but when he seemed aloof while she was struggling with her father’s illness, she turned on him and began egging his house every year.  The two no longer speak.  At the hardware store, MONA buys herself an ax.

The kids bring their parents to school for back-to-school night, and MONA is upset to meet LISA’s AUNT who is watching over the child while her mother is at the hospital.  LISA’S AUNT is bitter and insensitive to the child’s sadness.  “Recovers? What spaceship did you fall out of?”

BEN invites MONA to the movies but her anxieties overwhelm her and she rushes home to check her answering machine messages, to make sure nothing has happened to her father. Ben follows her home and the two nearly have sex, but MONA’s anxiety kicks in again and she asks him to leave.

Lisa brings MONA to visit her mother at the hospital.  LISA’s MOM is clearly nearing deaths’ door. 

During class, LISA and her nemesis ANN get into an argument that gets completely out of hand, and LISA blurts out that her mother has died. A chaotic melee ensues that includes a puddle of pee, an artificial limb, an enraged father in search of his artificial limb, and culminates with ANN nearly attacking Lisa with an axe.  The incident causes quite a bit of consternation among school officials, who, upon closer inspection, realize that MONA never graduated college and force her to resign. 

MONA irrationally fears that MR JONES has disappeared and she barges in on him having sex with a strange woman.  Mona admits that she’s been hurt by his aloofness, and Mr. Jones tells her that as a kid Mona had insulted him badly after her father got sick, and explains that the incident was the reason he never again inquired about her father’s health.  Mona recollects the incident and realizes that her misguided resentments and fears have been controlling her life. 

Ben comes to visit Mona and the two have sex.   Mona tells her father that she doesn’t think she can “keep him company any more.”  Mona adopts LISA and gets her teaching job back (by way of a lawsuit).

A young orphan in South Africa heads to Johannesburg to make find his uncle and make enough money to buy his grandmother a cow.

SUMMARY

MUSA, a young orphan has already lost his mother and his father is ill.  Townsfolk believe that his family is cursed.  His father passes away, giving him a drum that he made.  The “curse” spreads to the rest of the town and many people are dying.  Musa’s grandmother is struggling to support many children – all of whom’s parents have died.  The grandmother sacrificed the families biggest asset, a cow, in order to appease the god’s, a sacrifice made in vain.  Musa decides to move to Johannesburg to find his Uncle who is working there, and to make enough money to buy his grandmother a cow.  

Musa walks a great distance until he arrives at a market.  He asks a truck driver for a ride, but the shop owner shoos him away.  While the driver is fucking a prostitute, Musa sneaks into the back of the man’s truck. The man finds him and reluctantly decides to drive him to the city.  Along the way, Musa and the truck driver become friends, and the man warns Musa about  the evils of the big city.  

In the city, reality is harsh.  Musa befriends T, a street punk who steals from tourists.  Musa doesn’t want to resort to crime, and starts a career as a window washer.  T is beaten up and disappears.  Musa is heartbroken.  He is robbed by the same punks that beat up T.  The truck driver sees Musa looking dejected, and takes him along on his rounds.  Musa helps with the truck.  The driver takes him to the village where Musa gives his grandmother money and tells the village eldge that the “curse” on the village is AIDS.  The elder doesn’t listen to him.  Musa stays the night at the Truck Driver’s house, and the truck driver informs the town in a spontaneous meeting about the need to address AIDS as a major problem.  The driver finds out that Musa’s uncle was a guard for his company, and that he was shot and killed.  After giving Musa the bad news, The driver and his boss take Musa to a shelter that the boss’ dead son (AIDS) used to work at.  T is a resident at the shelter, and the two friends share a happy reunion.

COMMENTS

A heart warming film, the type that my mother would like (it would probably make her cry, in fact, a lot of the audience was crying after the film), but not a film made well enough to break through to large audiences.  The story unfolds very slowly, and I got tired of it.  Not very much happens, and the characters don’t make much of a journey  - the only characters that go through any changes are the boss and the truck driver, but there changes seem to happen very quickly.  The movie is definitely a message picture: AIDS epidemic in sub Saharan Africa needs to be addressed rather than ignored, but I have a feeling that this film will only preach to the choir, and will not generate many converts to this way of thinking.

LOGLINE 
In a closed space beneath 2500 pounds of Iraqi soil, PAUL has 90 minutes of oxygen left to breathe and his only connection to the outside world is a mysterious cell phone with limited reception and battery life. And each second he is a second closer to death…

COMMENTS 

Ryan Reynolds is not my favorite actor; and he is the ONLY person in this movie, (along with a bunch of voice actors he talks to on the phone).  The claustrophobia drives the story, and the script actually manages to move along pretty well for a story with such limited mobility. Movie is short but sweet; on script alone its worth considering for MIDD EAST, (although controversial?).  Others should wait; there is a presentation in AFM. 

SUMMARY 

An American contractor in Iraq gets taken hostage and buried in a coffin, where he is given a cell phone and a demand; get the US government to pay 5M dollars in ransom, or be killed. 

The film OPENS with PAUL in that box; after a few moments he realizes what a terrible situation he is in and begins to panic.  PAUL struggles to figure out a way out but realizes theres no way to open the coffin.  

He starts making desperate phone calls on the cell, despite being wary of the battery dying.  His wife doesn’t pick up her cell or her landline. He calls 911 in the US, but they have no idea what to do; he leaves a message for his rep at CRT; (his trucking company) and talks to an FBI agent, but the phone conversations seem useless; PAUL has no idea where he is, and they have no idea how to find him.  

JABIR, the kidnapper, calls PAUL and tells him he needs to get the government to give the kidnappers 5M dollars.  PAUL gets ahold of a US government crisis negotiator DAN; who promises to help, but insists that the US government will not negotiate with “terrorists.” As time starts to run out, PAUL caves in and sends a video message begging for the US to send money. The video gets onto youtube and the global news services. Meanwhile the terrorists send him a video where a hostage female gets shot and killed.

DAN and the government track PAUL’s cell, to no avail.  An airstrike hits the area around PAUL and sand starts pouring into his coffin, he is near death, but DAN calls with great news; an informer is leading them to the coffin.  The terrorists then insist PAUL cut off his own thumb on video. PAUL has no choice. He complies. He starts losing blood rapidly.

 DAN begs PAUL to hang on, but PAUL is moments away from suffocating. In a final, awful twist, DAN realizes that he has been led to the coffin of an American hostage who is already dead. PAUL dies.

New York City. In an expensive suit and tie, 28-year-old Eric Packer leaves his shimmering 89-story apartment building, puts his sunglasses on, walks across First Avenue and joins Torval, his bald, no-necked Chief of Security standing beside a white stretch limo. Eric announces he wants to go crosstown to get a haircut. Torval objects. The president's in town, the traffic will be horrendous. 

Shiner, Eric's Chief of Technology, sits opposite Eric. He assures him their system is secure, including this ultra high-tech limo. Eric wonders where the car slept last night. Shiner doesn’t know. Eric checks out the array of visual display units in the car. Touchscreens, microwave, heart monitor, a spycam on a swivel pointed at Eric. Shiner asks why they're in the car. Eric needs a haircut. He could get the barber to come to the car. There's no barber chair here. Nothing swivels but the spycam, says Eric. 

On Second Avenue, the traffic's gridlocked. Eric notices his beautiful wife of twenty-two days, Elise Shifrin, in a taxi. He takes her for pancakes and sausages in a packed 47th street coffee shop. Torval stands by the door. Eric asks when they're going to have sex again. Elise promises they will, but just now she needs her energy to write. She asks where he's going, what he does exactly. You're a dangerous person, she says. A visionary. 

Outside, Torval informs Eric he's received reports of a credible threat—to the president. Michael Chin joins Eric in the limo. He warns against betting so heavily on the yen falling. It can't go any higher, Eric assures him. He asks Michael how old he is. Twenty-two. He looks younger. Eric always used to look younger than anyone around him. One day, that changed. As he watches numbers on the screens, he recalls a line of a poem he read. A rat became the unit of currency...

Eric enters an apartment building. In her art-strewn apartment, he has sex with Didi Fancher, 47. Didi tells him about a masterpiece of modern art that will soon be available. Eric says he'd rather buy a whole chapel the artist designed. He'd move it intact into his apartment. Didi thought he'd be happy with one painting. Eric tells her he's losing millions today, betting against the yen. He wants her to make an offer for the chapel. 

Back in the car, Torval recommends extra security after an attack on the IMF managing director. On Park Avenue, Jane Melman, Eric's Chief of Finance, meets the limo, still sweaty from her jog. She reports bad news on the yen. It can't go any higher, insists Eric. Except it just did, replies Jane.

Dr. Ingram gets in the car for Eric's daily check-up. As Ingram examines him, Jane and Eric continue their discussion. The sexual tension rises. They reach Fifth Avenue. Jane jumps out and jogs away. Eric notices a guy at an ATM who seems familiar. Ingram informs Eric that his prostate is asymmetrical. 

In the diamond district, a water-main break stops the car. Torval has called up two extra security people, Danko and Kendra. Eric wanders into a bookstore. Elise is there, reading poetry. She says he smells of sex. Eric tells her it's his doctor's appointment. They cross the street for lunch, discuss childhood and going to the lake where it's quiet. Eric tries to persuade Elise to go to a hotel with him. Suddenly, two guys in gray spandex run in waving rats over their heads and yelling about a 'specter'. They lob the rats into the lunchtime crowd.

Stalled in traffic where Broadway and Seventh Avenue intersect, Eric talks to Vija Kinski, his Chief of Theory. Five protesters in gray spandex carry a Styrofoam rat chanting, A specter is haunting the world! Other protesters surround the limo. Torval decks a guy carrying a brick. Eric and Vija watch the protest. Rats are loosed in restaurants and hotels. Teenagers spray graffiti on the limo. The more visionary an idea, the more people it leaves behind, says Vija. The urge to destroy is a creative urge, replies Eric. 

Outside, there's a loud detonation. A specter is haunting the world! flashes up on an electronic display. Followed by, A rat became the unit of currency. Torval informs Eric there is a credible threat to his safety. Eric wants his haircut. Vija and Eric discuss the future. People will not die, she tells him. They will be absorbed in streams of information. Computers will die.

Night falls. In a hotel room, Eric makes love to Kendra. He asks if Danko, her partner, will be jealous. She says she's off duty. Isn't her job dangerous? The pay's good and it's interesting to be near a man somebody wants to kill. 

Leaving the hotel, Eric sees Elise outside the Barrymore Theater. He takes her to a Japanese restaurant, makes conversation, takes an interest. She asks if it was him she saw coming out of the hotel. He confesses that his firm's portfolio has been reduced to near nothingness. His personal fortune is gone. His life's under threat. But he feels free. Elise offers to lend him money to re-establish himself. That's all. As a marriage, they're done. You speak of being free. This is your lucky day.

Danko and Eric watch a rave in a shabby theater. Danko fought in the Balkan wars. Eric asks if he killed people. What do you think? replies Danko. Like lunch. 

As the car crosses Eighth Avenue, Torval explains that the threat is a single anonymous person. Eric seems unconcerned. The car is blocked by a funeral. Eric meets a friend, Kozmo Thomas. Who's died? Rap star Brutha Fez. Eric is dismayed. He visited Brutha Fez in L.A. He has his music in his elevator. How come he didn't know? He weeps for him. 

On 47th Street, watching a couple of kids play basketball across the street, Torval warns Eric there's an armed gunman tracking him. Eric shrugs it off. Torval's armed. He asks to see his gun. It's a handsome high-tech weapon with a voice-activated safety that only responds to Torval's pre-programmed code. Eric is impressed. What's the code? Nancy Babich, says Torval. Eric shoots him. He tosses the gun into some bushes.

The car crosses Tenth Avenue and stops outside a closed barbershop. Ibrahim, the driver, opens the door for Eric. He knocks on the barbershop door. Anthony, an old man in a barber's outfit, opens up.  It's been a long time. He ushers Eric into the single barber's chair, offers him some food and reminisces about Eric's parents. He knew the family well. They lived right across the street. While Eric and Ibrahim eat, Anthony recalls the days when he used to drive a cab. Ibrahim wonders where the Chief of Security is. Eric says he gave him the night off. Anthony and Ibrahim are amazed he ventures out in this part of town without protection. Anthony gives him his snub-nosed revolver. 

Back in the car, Eric wonders where the limo is parked at night. Ibrahim drives to an underground garage and lets Eric out before driving inside. Someone calls Eric's name. A shot rings out. Eric fires back wildly. He breaks into the derelict building where the shots came from and finds Benno Levin sitting with a towel over his head like a prayer shawl. A powerful military pistol lies on the table. Benno asks if Eric recognizes him. He's the guy Eric saw earlier at a cash machine. Benno asks why he's here. Some kind of unexpected failure? Eric admits he couldn't figure out the yen. Benno used to work for Eric. His real name is Richard Sheets. It means nothing to Eric. 

Benno says he needs to shoot Eric. There's no life for him unless he does. And Eric needs to die. When he self-destructs, Eric has to fail more, lose more, die more than the others. But falling three feet to his death isn't very heroic. Benno takes the gun out of Eric's hand. He starts pacing, his pistol in one hand, Eric's in the other. He slumps on the sofa, sets Eric's gun down on the table, pulls the towel lower on his face. He takes aim.

They sit there, waiting for the shot to sound.

On a world where half the planet is in permanent day, half in permanent night, the Lord of Darkness has stolen the sun.  One young dreamer must take up the mantle of Guardian of the Moon and travel on a quest to recover the sun and save the world. 

COMMENTS 
The script is overreaching, ambiguous at times, and contains some inconsistencies– as well as some hackneyed, reference-based humor.  While there are some interesting ideas, they aren’t fully explored and are often lost in the scramble for a coherent plot, or negated by the presence of a contradicting idea (e.g. anthropomorphized lava existing concurrently with fawns, elephants, etc.)  A contrived and poorly implemented conservationist moral message underlines much of the dialogue.  Generally scattered.  Pass. 

SUMMARY 
A comet sweeps around a world much like Earth, except that it is permanently half in day, half in night with the sun on the day side and a moon on the dark side.  The inhabitants of this planet, beings made of elemental matter, see the comet as a sign that new Guardians of the Sun and Moon are to be chosen.  In a tournament of challenges, brash and arrogant SOHONE easily wins the more physical events and the title of Guardian of the Sun.  No acceptable candidate for Guardian of the Moon can be found, and the crowd is shocked when MUNE is deposited in the arena by a cloud of bats and wins the title by winning over a timid fawn. 

Meanwhile, the Lord of Darkness, NECROSS, chastises his minions for failing to win the Guardianship of the Sun themselves.  He sends them back out to steal the sun.  MUNE, paranoid about the moon, pulls it from the sky and hides it in the temple.  SOHONE is furious about the turmoil this causes and rushes off to chastise MUNE, allowing NECROSS’s minions to steal the sun and plunge the world into darkness. 

Heading off to find the sun, MUNE and SOHONE are joined by GLIM, a beautiful girl made of wax.  They dive to the bottom of the sea and meet PHOSPHO, who is his own source of light.  He joins them on their quest and after they enlist their shadows as soldiers, the group splits up– MUNE and GLIM to recover the moon (just nabbed by a minion, SPLEEN) and PHOSPHO and SOHONE to get the sun.  MUNE and GLIM recover the moon from where SPLEEN had hidden it in his nightmares and hide it again deep in GLIM’s dreams.  They also start to fall in love and hope for a future together. 

While SOHONE battles NECROSS, MUNE and GLIM struggle to release the dying sun from its glass prison.  MUNE is blocked by minions, so a melting GLIM grabs the sun and pulls it out.  With a breath of wind, the sun sparks to life, dissolving NECROSS into nothing.  MUNE and GLIM find each other’s arms and SOHONE becomes a more patient and wise Guardian of the Sun.

A present-day journalist facing a mid-life crisis investigates the story of a Jewish girl’s tragic experience in WWII France. 

COMMENTS
This script portrays a gripping tragic story from the past that seems to get interrupted by a modern day woman’s bourgeois woes. Sarah’s tragedy springing from an ill-judged but well-intentioned youthful decision is incredibly compelling and stomach-churning. Anxiety, suspense, fear and heartbreak are imbued in every step of her journey. It is something of a letdown when Julia’s story resurfaces, but Julia’s investigation of Sarah’s current whereabouts keeps you reading. At a certain point, the dynamic of the two stories shifts so that we’re more focused on the impact that searching for Sarah has had on Julia’s life, and we see less and less of Sarah’s internal state, perhaps in an echo of the character cutting herself off from others including the reader. It would have been nice to learn more about Sarah’s decline into depression and her inability to trust herself or her heritage in regards to her son rather than just skip ahead to her tragic demise. 

Despite Sarah’s story being more intriguing, it does feel necessary to include Julia’s modern perspective to remind us that we must hold ourselves accountable for searching for the truth rather than accepting a collective flawed historical memory. The script ends in a conventionally old-fashioned sweet manner that seemed over-simplified, but there are definitely some hard profound emotional beats to get through first: when Sarah nearly loses her key at the camp and tries to grab it off the ground, a guard stomps on her closed fist. Instead of screaming in pain, the 10-year-old silently looks him in the eye until he’s ashamed of himself. It was difficult and wonderful to read that, and it would be even better to see that moment onscreen. CONSIDER. 

SUMMARY
In 1942 Paris, 10-year-old SARAH STARSYNZKI and her younger brother MICHEL play hide-and-seek in their apartment at Le Marais when the French police arrive to take the Jewish family by force. Sarah keeps Michel hidden and naively locks him in the closet, promising to let him out when it’s safe. Cut to present day Paris: journalist JULIA (40), her tween daughter ZOE and husband BERTRAND move into the same Le Marais apartment, which Bertrand’s family has occupied since 1942.  

Julia decides to write her next story on the Vel D’Hive after realizing none of the younger French writers recalls the incident. In 1942, 13000 Jews were arrested and detained in the Velodrome d’Hiver, Paris’ indoor bicycling stadium, before being sent to camps. The Vel D’Hive has since been torn down, and apart from Jacques Chirac’s acknowledgment and apology in 1995 of France’s active persecution of French Jews, the event has been forgotten by many.  

We intercut between Julia’s investigation and Sarah’s story in 1942. When Sarah’s parents are horrified to learn that Michel has been locked “safely” in the closet, Sarah begins to realize they may never be going home. They are crammed onto bleachers with thousands of other Jewish families with no bathrooms or water in the Vel D’Hive. Soon they are sent to Camp Beaune-la-Rolande, where they are separated. Sarah clings to her key to the closet and manages to escape the camp, assisted by a kind guard and another prisoner.  

Present day: Julia talks to elderly locals near the site of the Vel d’Hiv who remember being troubled by the mass arrests, but who could they report it to when the French policemen themselves were detaining the Jews? Julia then pays a visit to Bertrand’s grandmother MAME (95) at a retirement home and begins asking questions about who occupied their apartment before 1942. EDOUARD, Bertrand’s father, notices Julia’s inquiries into the history of the apartment. During her research, Julia discovers with joy that she is pregnant. But Bertrand, who enjoys their current mature lifestyle, wants Julia to consider an abortion. Angry with her husband, Julia throws herself into work and is shocked to learn that her husband’s family gained the apartment upon the arrest of Sarah’s family. She finds a photo of young Sarah and learns that although Sarah’s parents died in the camps, Sarah may still be alive. 

1942: Sarah is taken in by kindly farmer JULES and his wife. After successfully hiding her from a German search of the village, Jules takes an insistent Sarah to Paris to find her brother. A young boy answers the door to her old home and she sweeps by him and his father to the closet unlocks it with her key… and finds her brother’s decaying corpse.  
Present day: Edouard finally speaks to Julia about the apartment – he and his father ANDRE were home that horrific day when the boy’s body was found in their closet, a secret they kept from their entire family. Following the incident, Andre sent money every month to Jules to help provide for Sarah, who stayed on as an adopted daughter. Julia neglects her abortion appointment in favor of pursuing the search for what happened next to Sarah. She left the farm in 1953 and was married to a Mr. Rainsferd in Connecticut. 

When Julia shows up at the Rainsferd residence, it is Mr. Rainsferd’s second wife who is home, not Sarah. In a flashback, we see a middle-aged Sarah drinking and OD-ing before driving into a truck. Mr. Rainsferd is too ill to meet Julia, but the new Mrs. Rainsferd mentions her stepson (Sarah’s son) WILLIAM now lives in Italy. Julia travels and meets with the charming William who becomes hostile when Julia brings up his mother’s past in Paris and insists angrily that he isn’t Jewish before leaving. At a dead end, Julia returns to Paris where an upset Bertrand, who now knows the truth about the apartment, says they’re selling the place. After disagreeing again about the abortion, Julia leaves, wondering whether her search for the truth has been worth disturbing so many lives.  
Several years later, William meets a divorced Julia in New York with her baby daughter. 

After Julia’s visit, he met with his father and discussed his mother’s depression and irrational fear of endangering her son if he grew up with a Jewish identity. He also received her diary and the closet key she never discarded. He’s taken his wife and children to meet their extended family in Israel. When Julia reveals she has named her daughter Sarah, William thanks her for everything with tears in his eyes.

A defense attorney gets caught in a sticky case; representing a client who is guilty of a crime another one of his clients got sent to prison for… the case threatens to unhinge MICK’s career and threaten the lives of him and his friends and family.
 
COMMENTS 
I should start by saying I like the script (think LAW ABIDING CITIZEN but smarter); it reminds me of the good, tense legal thrillers a la early Grisham, or Scott Turow… but I have concerns: firstly – it feels very American; the genre is decidedly American, coupling that with the stereotypical macho lead, and a quintessential American actor, McConaughey (who’s range has been considerably stunted while spending a decade doing rom coms) and you’ve got a film more geared for domestic.    He was pretty good in A TIME TO KILL, and this role is very similar.   Tommy Lee Jones lends an air of gravitas in both his role as director and as a supporting actor.  My other concern is that a few Lakeshore’s recent projects have looked better on the page than on the screen.  My feelings are very mixed, and I would say that, ultimately it is too clichéd, too American for an international audience.  Good for popcorn, if legal thrillers work.  It’s a courtroom drama, with only a short action sequence at the end. 
 
SUMMARY
MICK, a hot shot defense attorney, gets tipped to a case where a defendant is up on a million dollar bail.  LOUIS ROULET, a young man in Bev Hills realty who comes from a ton of money is in jail for beating up a woman. He claims he’s framed but MICK doesn’t care; he gets LOUIS out on bail and talks the family into hiring the bail bondsman, VALENZUELA, who turned MICK onto the case. 
 
LOUIS insists on pleading not guilty and swears he is innocent; “there won’t be any negotiation.” MICK nods and asks him to explain everything that happened.  LOUIS tells them that he met the victim, REGINA at a bar and she told him to come back to her house, where he immediately got jumped and framed for beating her.  She claims he showed up unannounced and beat her. 
 
MICK gets video from the bar that confirms LOUIS’s story and he thinks he has the goods on the new Ivy League educated Prosecutor, but is blinded by two pieces of evidence; Louis paid Regina for sex, and was carrying the knife used in the attack… a customized knife with his initials on it.  LOUIS still maintains that he is innocent. 
 
MICK’s ex, MAGGIE (who is also the mother of his kid, HAYLEY) runs into him at a bar. He pumps her for some info before the two go home together.  In the morning, they resume fighting. 
 
MICK starts piecing the puzzle together and realizes that there’s an incredible similarity to a case he already worked; he had a client named MARTINEZ who is doing a life sentence for killing a hooker.  MARTINEZ always maintained that he was innocent, but MICK advised him to take a deal.  MICK realizes that LOUIS was the killer, and that he hired MICK so that MICK would be caught in a ‘trick bag,’ with one client in jail for a crime another client committed… and MICK can’t use any of the info against LOUIS because it would violate attorney client privilege. 
 
LOUIS shows up in MICK’s house, admits to killing the victim in the Martinez case, and gives MICK a veiled threat.  Shortly later, MICK’s friend and biz partner FRANK gets killed.  MICK may be getting framed for the murder; FRANK was killed with MICK’s gun. 
 
Louis’s case goes to court.  MICK defends him, despite knowing that he is guilty, and he does a great job, getting the case thrown out… but while doing so, he manages to get a witness to implicate LOUIS in the Martinez murder.  After LOUIS gets found guilty of the one crime, he immediately gets arrested for the second…. But he gets released quickly because they don’t have enough to charge him.  MICK fears that LOUIS will come after him and his family, so he warns MAGGIE to grab HAYLEY and hide. 
 
MICK catches LOUIS trying to get into MAGGIE’s house.  LOUIS threatens him; “you gonna wait here every day? Every night?” MICK doesn’t have to; a few of his clients, biker gang types, roll up and beat LOUIS to a pulp.  Meanwhile, MAGGIE finds evidence linking LOUIS to the Martinez murder; Martinez gets off and LOUIS will be charged, and given the death penalty.   LOUIS’s mother breaks into MICK’s house, carrying the gun LOUIS stole. She shoots MICK and MICK fires back, killing her. (SHE is the one who killed FRANK, most likely.)

COMMENTS:
Popcorn only. The plot is farfetched and the dialogue filled with one liners. I didn't laugh, but it is very possible Katherine Heigl could deliver the lines in such a way that they'll become funny. It is a romantic comedy with soft action, geared to a female audience with very strong elements. Katherine Heigl is very popular and she does know how to open a film. Lions Gate bought domestic rights, so that is also an element in the film's favor. This film will not win any awards, but could be a winner at the box office.

STEVE'S COMMENTS: Fun, commercial, good lead character.  Does Katherine Heigl mean anything in Lat Am? Is she a big enough name yet for that price?  The plot, at first, seems like it's going to be pretty stupid; and it is similar to THE BOUNTY HUNTER, (i think, i havent seen that one); but the writing is quite slick and delivers a strong, hollywood popcorn comedy.  There are definitely funny moments; and a lot of potential for slapstick comedy. could be a date movie that guys would agree to go to.  Consider.

SUMMARY:
OPEN in an apartment where a good-looking if scruffy cop, MORELLI, comes looking for CARMEN.  He is surprised by the sight of another man named ZIGGY.  From Carmen’s bedroom, a FLAT NOSED GUY emerges.  BAM!  Ziggy goes down with a bullet to the forehead and Morelli is knocked unconscious with a gun in his hand.
 
Trenton New Jersey.  STEPHANIE drives across a bridge but sees the re-po GUY behind her.  She’s four months behind on her payments. She tosses the keys off the side of the bridge.  She goes to dinner with her PARENTS and GRANDMA that night and tells them that she lost her job … six months ago.  Now she has no income, no car.  Her life is shit.  Her MOTHER mentions a guy she obviously knows, a cop named MORELLI, and says he killed someone.  The news shakes her.  Her FATHER suggests she move back in with them “like after the divorce.”  She declines.  She has a new apartment (with barely any furniture), and the next day, Grandma arrives with a gift:  her huge, blue 1972 Buick Riviera.

Stephanie tries to get a filing job with her cousin VINNIE, but all he’s got left is a crappy job dealing with lowlifes:  tracing those who have skipped bail.  Stephanie notices that Morelli skipped bail.  She lobbies for the gig, she’s that desperate (and hates Morelli that much), but Vinnie thinks she lacks experience.  She blackmails him over a dominatrix he used to patronize.  

Stephanie first heads to Morelli’s apartment but he’s not there.  She follows his ugly COUSIN to a soap factory, and hurries up the stairs to confront Morelli.  They have a history; they slept together once, and she later hit him with her car.  He finds it funny that she wants to take him in but as a cop, he has no intention of going to prison.  He races away and tosses her car keys into a dumpster so she can’t follow.

Vinnie’s assistant CONNIE gives Stephanie the number of another bounty hunter named RANGER, an ex-military type who calls Stephanie an amateur.  She doesn’t even own a gun.  Morelli is way out of her league.  He takes her to a shooting range, impresses her with his skills, and buys her a gun, insisting that she pay him back.  She is summoned to the office of Trenton POLICE CAPTAIN GAZARRA, an old family friend, and surprises him with everything she has picked up about Morelli’s case.  Gazarra reluctantly shares Morelli’s file with her.  She reads that Morelli was called to a house by CARMEN SANCHEZ, then claimed he shot an armed attacker named ZIGGY in self-defense.  Later investigation proved Ziggy was unarmed.

Stephanie stops by the home of Morelli’s MOTHER, who is furious at her for breaking her son’s leg with her car.  HOOKERS on the street outside tell her Carmen’s boyfriend BENITO works out at the nearby gym, so she goes in there.  Benito is a hulking mass of muscle who threatens her and pulls at her hard once too hard; she clocks him with her purse (containing new gun) and runs.  Someone from outside gets a shot off at her.  She hides in the alley and is pulled to safety by Joe Morelli, who unloads the bullets from her gun, insists that he is innocent, and tells her that Carmen was his informant.  Ziggy was moving heroin into Trenton and Benito was his muscle. 

At home, Stephanie is bummed that her parents invited BERNIE KUNTZ over for dinner.  He’s chubby and balding, and she’s not interested.   Then she gets a threatening call from Benito that scares her.  She enlists Ranger’s help; he picks the lock of Morelli’s apartment, and she grabs Morelli’s car keys off a hook.  Now she has a ride that’s not as easily spotted.  Strapped for cash, she brings in a few comic stragglers who missed their court dates (ie. an elderly exhibitionist).

Ranger comes over, they make dinner, he’s clearly attracted.  She pays him for the gun, and removes the distributor cap off Morelli’s car and hides it in some bushes.  She’s in the shower when Morelli appears and demands it back.  She refuses.  He handcuffs her to the shower rod searches for it but finally leaves, and Stephanie summons Ranger, who releases her and teases her about her obvious feelings for Morelli.  She is surprised.

Stephanie goes to Carmen’s apartment, believing that Carmen told someone about what she saw the night of the shooting.  There, she sees a blue Porsche drive slowly by.  An OLD MAN on a nearby stoop gives the car the finger after it passes.  Inside Carmen’s place, she comes upon an older woman named ROSA, a friend of Carmen, who directs her to the apartment of another neighbor, an Asian guy named CHO with a weird snake tattoo on his forehead who mentions a FLAT NOSED GUY (from the opening scene) and says that the cop “had no gun.”  Ranger picks Stephanie up to “have some fun” and takes her to pick up an ‘easy’ case.  He tries to teach her something about bounty hunting, but Stephanie makes some rookie mistakes and loses her gun … which the guy, LONNIE, uses to shoot Ranger in the thigh.  Lonnie flees and Stephanie clothes-lines him down.  They take him in.  Stephanie apologizes to Ranger, and then takes snacks back to the Hookers who have been acting as her informal informers. They confirm that the Porsche she saw driving by belongs to Benito.

Stephanie pays Ranger a visit at the hospital and learns that Cho ‘fell’ from his apartment window.  She’s sure he was killed and races to Gazarra to demand police protection for Rosa Gomez.  Gazarra thinks she is overreacting.  She gets two threatening voice-mails from Benito and hurries to the firing range to settle her nerves.  She arrives home to find Morelli there, gaunt and scared.  She teases him – now the tables are turned – but invites him to stay.  There’s obvious sexual attraction here.  Morelli figures that Benito is the key to the mystery and wants Stephanie to ‘draw him out’. He puts a wire on her so that he can hear everything she says (as long as they stay within 100 yards of each other).

They are interrupted by the unexpected arrival of MORTY, another bounty hunter who wants her to back off so he can grab Morelli and the reward.  She refuses but doesn’t see that Morty lifts her (Morelli’s) car keys from her purse.  He goes to steal the car but it explodes as Stephanie and Morelli watch, aghast, from an upstairs window.  When Gazarra arrives, he questions her about Morelli but she plays dumb, and is horrified to learn that Benito beat one of her Hooker informers.  She races to the hospital; the Hooker is bruised but otherwise all right.  Jimmy Alpha (the gym owner) also arrives with flowers.  Then Stephanie gets a call from Gazarra.  Rosa’s apartment was just firebombed.  Rosa is fine, however; Gazarra ended up taking Stephanie’s plea seriously and put Rosa in protective custody.  Stephanie goes to chat with Old Man in the alley, who complains to her about the “reefer” trucks parking outside all night.  She thinks it’s a tip and calls Ranger, who assures her that the Old Man means “refrigerator” trucks.  Ooops.

While buying a new shower curtain at Bernie’s, Stephanie doesn’t see a truck backing up to SAL’S Butcher Shop nearby.  But then she catches sight of the driver – Flat Nose – and gets 
suspicious.  She pretends to buy some fish, but then alerts Morelli of what’s going on (via the 
transmitter in her wire).  She watches Sal argue with Flat Nose and then close the shop, and she follows the meat truck, telling Morelli of their location.  They end up at the Marina.  Morelli appears, draws his gun and tells her to stay put.  

Morelli sneaks into the Marina.  All is quiet.  He finds Sal’s boat and realizes that they are smuggling heroin on it.  Stephanie appears – she doesn’t ‘stay put’.  They go back to the meat truck and find Sal and Flat Nose inside, dead.  They look frantically for Ziggy’s gun, the gun that would exonerate Morelli, but before they find it, Benito appears with a gun.  Morelli kicks him under the chin, knocking him out, and they handcuff him to the truck.

They are interrupted by Jimmy Alpha, the mastermind behind the smuggling plot.  Gun out, he forces Stephanie to handcuff Morelli to the truck instead and hand over all their guns.  Morelli quietly urges Stephanie to let Jimmy talk – he’s wired.  And talk he does, spilling all the self-incriminating details.  Suddenly, Stephanie launches herself into Jimmy’s abdomen, forcing him onto the pavement and unconscious– he gets a shot off, and she is hit in the butt.  Morelli frees himself and starts to get off the boat to help Stephanie, but she shuts the door and locks him inside.  She drives the meat truck to the police station, collects her receipt for the delivery of Morelli (whom she tells Gazarra is perfectly clean).

CUT TO days later, Ranger drives a sore Stephanie home from the hospital.  He tells her Benito will go to prison and Morelli is already cleared.  She takes the receipt to Vinnie, who cuts her a $50,000 check, and there she sees that one of the Hookers has started working as a receptionist.  She buys a new car and heads over to Morelli’s apartment.  He wonders if she’ll now head back to the city.  She’s not sure, she says in a flirty tone.  They kiss.

TITLE: Bodyguard of Lies

A Spanish Rogue manages to earn the trust of both the Germans and the British in WW2 and becomes modern warfare’s most influential double agent, all while hiding the true purpose of his mission.

COMMENTS

A bit disappointing, I was more excited by the agent’s pitch than I ever was actually reading the script, which layers deceit on top of deceit with the implicit promise that a great secret about Pujol’s true allegiance would be revealed, ultimately leaving the  climax  as a bit of a let down.  Great international premise and fun role for Brody, but the script’s focus on Harris’ family and the strange relationship motivations between Pujol’s “mission” hindered what could have been a truly smart and unique film; The Harris family subplot introduced some heavy handed heartstring manipulation, while Pujol’s deep dark secret (he’s an orphan simply trying to impress his stern father) is a curveball that felt incomplete despite its basis in reality.  Hallstrom’s last project THE HOAX is tonally and thematically very similar, and though it too was based on a “truth is stranger than fiction” real life story, the direction wasn’t amazing and the film was a flop.  Execution of this type of story is quite tricky as it’s a period piece striving for intelligence, humor and intrigue, and I fear it’s the type of cross genre project that winds up alienating audiences rather than appealing to a large cross section.  Not a prebuy.

SUMMARY

MADRID JUAN PUJOL enters the German Embassy and wows high level agents including BREUGHEL with his intimate knowledge of their lives.  Juan vows to hate STALIN and offers his services in support of the Fuhrer.  Juan is sent to Britain to work as a spy. 

Juan sends coded letters back to Berlin, writing in florid detail about military goings on in Britain, and despite his fanciful storytelling a few of his details ring true and the Germans fund what they believe to be a massive “network” of spies run through Pujol, known as the “Arabol Network.” 

After earning the German trust, Juan approaches AGENT TOM HARRIS of the MI5.  Harris, aware of the presence of the spy “Arabol” had been on his tail for some time, and is understandably surprised by his unexpected arrival.  Juan insists that he’s loyal to the Allied forces and hates Adolf Hitler; he offers his services as a double agent.  Harris is shocked to realize that all of his letters to the Germans are completely fabricated: there is absolutely no network of spies… Pujol has fabricated every word of his correspondence.  

Harris and Pujol begin to collaborate on the letters in an attempt to confuse the Germans and surround the true Allied mission with a “Bodyguard of Lies.” Pujol is treated Royal by the MI5, given a lovely home and increased freedom, but he still seems unsatisfied and lonely.  Pujol continually tries to pry into Harris’ private life, and the Agent explodes when he finds Juan sharing an uninvited dinner with Harris’ family.  

Pujol manages to insist on weekly dinners at Harris’ home in return for his continued cooperation.  When a German spy comes to London to check on the validity of Pujol’s claims, Pujol narrowly manages to elude detection as a double agent.  Berlin continues to believe in his loyalty.

Pujol develops feelings for HILDY, Harris’ wife, and sabotages their relationship by insinuating that Harris has renewed an old extramarital affair with aide MARIE.  Hildy leaves Harris, taking their two young children to her sisters.  Harris explodes, literally strangling Pujol, before the agent is restrained and removed from the duty of working with Pujol.  

Harris grows increasingly suspicious of Pujol.  On the eve of the attack on Normandy, the MI5 is attempting to trick the Germans into moving troops out of Normandy, and Pujol is the key component in this subterfuge, but his row with Harris has threatened to destroy the operation.  Harris finds out that Pujol’s true allegiance is not to any government agenda: Pujol has engineered everything to impress his long lost father FERNANDO CONTRERAS: He has attempted to become a military hero and a family man in order to win the affection of his father.  When his father reproaches him again, Pujol is devastated and only a heartfelt intervention by Harris and his family convince Pujol to trick the Germans one final time.  

Based on their belief in “Arabol” the Germans move troops out of Normandy, a mistake that winds up costing them the war.  Pujol is awarded the highest medal of valor in Britain.

A young French con artist seemingly tricks a Louisiana family into believing that he’s their long lost son, but finds that his new “family”  has almost as much to hide.
 
COMMENTS

The lead male role has the potential to be extremely chilling, a possible break out role for  Grondin; but in order to sustain the eerie feel and make this movie work,  the young actor will be relied on heavily, indeed, a near virtuoso performance is necessary. Felicity Huffman’s role (presumably as Nick’s troubled mother) is juicy as well.  On the negative side, I think the fact that the story is essentially a detective novel, with all the action being viewed through the eyes of the FBI agent NANCY (Famke Jensen likely) greatly hinders the project. I felt the remarkably disturbing character becomes undermined by the hackneyed, formulaic genre in which his story is crammed.  With great performance this will be noteworthy.


SUMMARY

“I was locked in a house, taken hostage. Raped.” FREDERIC, a young Frenchman with a knack for adopting radically different personalities flees his native country and heads to the United States, where he poses as a missing child NICK who’d disappeared years ago.  With only a cursory knowledge of Nick’s background, Frederic’s plan seems farfetched, indeed the police and FBI agent NANCY RYAN are skeptical of “Nick” from the get go, but strangely, Nick’s family never seems to openly debate the identity of their returned “son,” despite consistent harangues and investigations.  CAREY, Nick’s sister is the most openly loving.  BEVERLY, the mother, seems a bit suspicious, but her hard partying ways and gruff exterior make her hard to read, and she keeps “Nick” at a distance.  Nick’s brother JASON seems openly hostile, but he too stops short of blowing the whistle on the imposter.  NANCY defies her superiors and ramps up her investigation of “Nick’s” identity, pressuring Carey to have “Nick” admitted into a hospital where DNA tests reveal that he indeed is not Nick.  When Nancy confronts Beverly with the truth, the mother slaps her in the face and defends “Nick.”  “We don’t ever want to see you again.” When Nancy again perserveres “Nick” attempts (or fakes to attempt) suicide, blaming Nancy for his grief.   Beverly’s behavior gets more erratic.  Nick moves in with her and catches her doing heroine.  Nick begins to fear for his safety and believe that Jason may have killed the real Nick and that Beverly may have known about it. “It’s God who sent you to punish me… you can’t die twice.”  Six Years Later Nick / Frederic is at it again, trying to convince French Authorities that he’s  a victimized child name FELIX.   Frederic asks Nancy to testify on his behalf, attesting to his instable mental capacity as a result of his ordeal “being pressured into lying about his identity” by Nick’s family.  Nancy does not come to his defense.“This time, Frederic, you really have to stop.”

COMMENTS

A well done adaptation with crackling dialog, rich setting and a story that moves along at a rapid clip.  Wade and Dan are the perfect yin and yang, defying the good guy/ bad guy stereotypes by being robust characters, men with tough choices and hard pasts… I’m a sucker for Elmore Leonard, and this story was satisfying in every way.  With the good director and strong cast, I give it a firm recommendation.

SUMMARY

DAN EVANS is a cattle rancher, who’s land is lying fallow due to a prolonged drought in the region.  His son WILLIAM is getting frustrated with their hard knock life and wants to run away from home, his son MARK suffers from chronic respiratory problems, and his wife is terrified that the family is going to starve.  

WADE, a ruthless outlaw, leads a gang of sharp-shooting, murderous bad guys with questionable loyalties.  Wade and his gang attack an armored stagecoach.  The coach is being guarded by Pinkerton Security guards, led by McELROY, whose got many years of service..  

The gang quickly kills several guards, but the armored walls of the coach are hard to penetrate.  Wade spooks DAN’s herd of cattle, causing them to stampede and knock over the coach, killing a few more guards, toppling the coach, and badly wounding McElroy. McElroy and Wade are old foes.  “I’m not gonna kill you,” Wade tells him.  

A young Pinkerton guard springs up and grabs a gang member, holding a gun to his head.  Wade doesn’t hesitate, he shoots his own man, knocking him to the ground, and kills the security guard.  

“He just shot his own man…”  Evans and his boys are standing on the hill, having watched the entire incident.  Marc is shocked, but William seems fascinated.  Wade sees the family and rides up to them.  Evans holds his ground, tells Wade that he wants his cattle back, and assures him that he wont tell the authorities. 

Wade and his men ride into the nearest town and tell the Marshall, WEATHERS that there was a stage coach hijacking, and the bandits stole the railroad’s loot.   BUTTERFIELD, the railroad owner is in the police station as well, and insists they go chase the bandits. Weathers, his deputy and Butterfield head off on a wild goose chase, while the gang walks into a local saloon. No one realizes that Wade has pulled a fast one on them, despite the fact that his wanted picture was plastered on the wall of the hq.

Wade and his men split up the loot, and Wade takes the local barmaid to bed, telling his men to head off without him.    Meanwhile, Butterfield and the lawman talk to Dan Evans, and realize they’ve been had. They turn to return to town in the hopes of catching up to Wade.

Dan walks into the bar and talks to Wade, telling him that he wants to be paid for the cattle that died in the robbery.  Wade obliges, surprised by the man’s confidence, but quickly gets upset when he realizes he’s been set up – WEATHERS and his deputies bust in and arrest him.  “Smile while you can,” he says to Evans coolly.

The lawmen realize that Wade’s men are going to return to town and kill them all if they don’t get Wade to a more secure location.  They ask for volunteers and offer a reward for joining their team.  McElroy, the Pinkerton guard, Billengsley and Dan all join.  Dan realizes that he can use the reward money to save his ranch.

In order to throw the gang off their tail, the secretly switch Wade out of the prison stagecoach, hoping that the gang will head off after it.  They give a deputy a gun, and Wade’s hat, and have him sit inside, pretending to be the outlaw.

Meanwhile, they stash Wade in Dan’s house.  His wife is livid about the whole proposition, and terrified to have the criminal in their home.  Dan insists that he must go, telling her they need the reward money, saying that if he dies, “at least I’ll go on my own two feet, not down on my knees praying for rain.”  

The lawmen head off, hoping to put Wade on the 3:10 to Yuma, a prison train that will bring Wade to lockup.  William sneaks out of the house and follows his father on the trail, refusing to turn back, even after stern retrobukes from Dan.  That night, while sitting by a campfire, Wade whips out a shiv and kills one of the deputies.  

The next day, the gang catches up to the prison coach and sets it on fire.  Terrified, the deputy tells the gang that Wade is being brought to the train station.  The gang let the deputy burn to death. 

The team crosses a ravine, where Wade gets the jump on McElroy and kills him.  Wade nearly gets away, but William manages to cross the ravine and point a gun at him, a teenager holding the ruthless killer at bay.  Later, Wade goes into the woods to take a piss, with Dan standing look out.  They get attacked by natives, and Wade saves the day, killing all the Indians.  Wade spares the lives of William, Dan and the others, before riding off, a free man (albeit one still in handcuffs). 

Wade makes his way to group of railroad workers and tries to get a chinese woman to smash off his handcuffs.  Wade is caught and tortured by a vicious team of workers.  Dan saves him, but during the skirmish another one of their team, DOC POTTER gets shot and killed.  Wade, Dan, William and Butterfield escape through a tunnel, the railroad gang forced to give up their chase when the tunnel collapses.  

Shortly after, Wade’s gang finds the Railroad gang and inquires about Wade’s whereabouts, before kills all of them.

Dan and the others make it to the town with the train station, CONTENTION, a run down hellhole full of drunks and whores.  They have two hours to kill before the train arrives.  They hole up in a hotel and wait nervously.  Butterfield hires local lawmen to help and they sit in the room, as Wade calmly tells them that his gang is going to kill them all.  William keeps lookout, and returns with the news that the gang is coming.  “Which is it boy?  Ten or eleven?

The gang arrives and quickly finds Wade.  They stand in the street outside the hotel, and CHARLIE, who’s been leading them in Wade’s absence, calls out to all the locals, offering a reward for any townsfolk who shoot any of the lawmen.  The riff raff hoot and holler, running off to get any weapons they can find.  The lawmen now have to deal with not only Wade’s gang of vicious killers, but a townfull of defacto bounty hunters as well.  One by one, the Contention lawmen give up.  Even Butterfield’s resolve dies, and he begs Dan to  give it up, telling him that he’ll still pay him.  Dan insists on taking Wade to the train, knowing that it’s his own death sentence.  He sends William away with Butterfield. “You just remember how your old man walked Ben Wade to the train station, when no one else would.”  William reluctantly leaves.

The clock hits three and Dan valiantly leads Wade out at gun-point.  The two men dodge gun fire as they hide behind stage coaches, run through alleys, across rooftops and through factories. Wade, who seems to be growing fond of Dan, even kills one of the townsfolk. “That was for saving me.  Now we’re even.”  Dan kills his first man.  “Don’t worry, you get used to it.”

Unbelievably, Dan and Wade make it to the train station, but the 3:10 to Yuma is late.  Dan hides in a ticket booth as the gang circle him.  William, who turned back to help his father, cuts loose a herd of cattle, reminiscent of Wade’s ploy during the stagecoach robbery.  The herd stampedes past the station, and almost provides the perfect distraction… the gang can’t get off a shot.  Just as Dan is about to put Wade on the train, Charlie walks up, guns drawn.  “Put your guns down, Charlie, that’s an order,” Wade barks.   Charlie ignores him and shoots Dan.  Wade holds Dan, and as he dies, the skies open up and rain begins to fall, the drought finally over.  Wade, in a rage, kills Charlie, along with all of his gang.   “Did you see that?  He just shot his own men!”

William walks up and points his gun at Wade, who has already tossed his guns on the ground.  William has bloodlust in his eyes, but takes his father’s advice, “never kill an unarmed man.”

Wade rides off, alone.

Pricing coming Monday.,,,*B Popcorn,,,,"LOGLINE:
When a teenage boy starts to suspect he was abducted as a small child, he makes inquiries only to discover that he is being pursued by well-funded, expert Ukrainian assassins.

COMMENTS: Tightly written, suspenseful.  Fast-paced.  Not a hugely believable idea, but who cares?  ABDUCTION is an interesting “what if?” that plays out well, has a young male protagonist who is both confused and heroic, and audiences looking for an upbeat actioner with some clever plot twists could do a lot worse.  ABDUCTION is an appealing package for all ages, with strong and exciting action sequences (although there’s nothing new – is there anything new anymore? – and basically everyone but the key players die).  Good commercial appeal, both theatrical and otherwise.  Might not make the top 10 list but should do decent business.  Popcorn only.

Steve's comments: A piece of business that could work for popcorn territories only; there's a LOT of suspension of belief required to enjoy this film, and the plot twists come fast and furious.  I could definitely have done with some better dialog and less characters; I felt like they introduced a new suspicious character every five pages or so.  Not an amazing script, but not terrible either - good action writing for the most part, and it was engaging and exciting, if pretty unbelievable.  Singleton is a decent director as well, so this should be a good bet, I'm just not super passionate about it.  Popcorn B list.

SUMMARY:
OPEN in 1994, inside a hotel near Toronto’s CN Tower.  A room is filled with poisonous gas and a WOMAN gasps for breath.  Her attackers are KOZLOW and BECKER, Ukrainians.  Kozlow gives her a mask to breath for a moment, and demands to know where “The Locust” is.  The woman refuses to tell him and rips off her mask, throwing it away.  It lands under the bed.  Kozlow and Becker discover a file of interest among the Woman’s things.  They leave her to die.

Present day Virginia.  NATHAN HARPER is a normal teenager, living with his parents and going to school like millions of other teenagers.  Though he parties with his friends and appears well-loved by his parents, he nonetheless feels like a man apart and wonders how it can be that he was raised by his parents and barely knows them.  He sees a PSYCHIATRIST for insomnia and anxiety attacks, and he often speaks of a recurring dream/nightmare where an unfamiliar WOMAN sings him a lullaby (“Que Serra”) before leaving him alone in the dark.  

KAREN is a pretty cheerleader with a boyfriend, and Nathan notices her.  She doesn’t seem to see him, even though she lives across the street.  One day she records him singing to himself and posts it on youtube.com, causing Nathan enormous embarrassment.  He lashes out at her and she responds, but she eventually realizes just how hurtful her actions were.  She apologizes several times before Nathan finally agrees to forgive her, and they mark their new friendship by partnering on a school essay about missing children.

As Karen and Nathan begin their research, they find a website with a little boy who looks very much like Nathan.  He is shaken.  Despite the reassurance of his classroom partner KAREN he calls the missing children line, but when he is asked for his address he senses something awry and hangs up.  He even finds the same shirt he was wearing in the picture – and it has the same ketchup stain on the shoulder.  

But Nathan’s call is secretly monitored by an OLDER MAN, who is concerned.  

The next day, Karen comes over and goes innocently into the bathroom.  At that moment, two mysterious MEN show up at Nathan’s house and confront his parents about Nathan’s search of the missing children’s website.   Nathan’s parents reach for hidden guns while Nathan, oblivious, receives a call on his cell from the Older Man.  The Older Man tells Nathan to get out of the house, and astonishes the teen by mentioning his private dream of the woman singing to him.  He tells Nathan that he was hired by his real father to keep him safe.  Suddenly, downstairs, guns go off and both Nathan’s parents are killed; Karen sees the whole thing but remains hidden.  The police swarm in, Nathan takes off, returns to save Karen, and then they book it the hell out of there.  

Now on the run, Karen is taken into custody as Nathan meets the Older Man in a pub.   The TV news blares that he is a suspect, and the pub patrons surround him until the Older Man brandishes a shotgun and gets him out of there.  He gives the teen instructions to find a man named RASMUS in Modesto.   Suddenly the car they are in is pushed from a bridge by another car, and the Older Man is killed.  Nathan swims to safety as bullets fly around him.  

Back at Nathan’s house, police detective WESLEY investigates the murders of his parents and is
helped by an arson expert he requested from the US Marshals, JACK SHAPIRO.  Shapiro and his partner reveal that the weaponry used in the attack was foreign-made and far beyond anything a teenager had means for; they further reveal that the home was extensively monitored by surveillance cameras.  

Nathan contacts his best friend GILLY who meets him with a number of brand new IDs and a gun (which Nathan refuses).  Karen meets them, determined to stay with Nathan.

They board a train.  Karen leaves Nathan to get them food from the dining car, but the generous portions she takes tips off a STRANGER who follows her, attacks her, leaves her barely conscious and takes the key to their sleeping compartment.  The Stranger finds Nathan, who outsmarts him, kills him, and then takes Karen off the train to a small town after rifling through some of the Stranger’s papers (with Ukrainian writing on them).  

Nathan and Karen try to bandage their wounds and change their appearances.  They enter a drugstore but the OWNER is clearly hostile, so they hurry out only to find themselves surrounded by (unarmed) CIA men headed by FRANK BOYER.  Boyer produces Nathan’s psychiatrist, who was working for them all along.

Boyer sends Karen home, and explains to Nathan that his real father is a deep cover black ops agent (known as “the Locust”) with powerful enemies across the globe.  If those enemies learned of Nathan’s existence, his father would be vulnerable.  So Nathan has been hidden and under federal protection his entire life.  His parents, he is told, wanted him to have a normal teenage life, so they pulled the daily detail that had been following him everywhere.

Elsewhere, Wesley is told by the CIA to cover up Nathan’s retrieval; they don’t want the info leaked.  Instead, he passes on information of Nathan’s location to someone via phone in exchange for money.  

While on the plane with the CIA team preparing for take-off, Nathan notices a telephone number found in the Stranger’s belongings.  He furtively calls the number and gets SHEALY, a CIA operative working with Boyer, and sitting just a few feet away.  So Shealy is working with the Ukrainians!  In a panic, he flees from the plane but is quickly recaptured, this time by Kozlow and Becker.  Kozlow reveals that his personal vendetta against Nathan is because Nathan’s father killed Kozlow’s son.  Boyer insists it was the result of an accident but Kozlow isn’t moved. 

Nathan is knocked unconscious, and when he awakens he finds that Kozlow also abducted Karen when she was returned home.  They are in the same hotel room where he gassed the young Woman 15 years earlier.  That woman was Nathan’s Mother, and Kozlow confesses his error:  he let the Woman die but never checked under the bed.  FLASHBACK to that scene, where the Woman flings the gas mask under the bed, where 3 year old Nathan quickly put it on and survived.  Kozlow intends to torture Nathan to death, but suddenly sniper fire breaks out, aiming only at Kozlow and Becker.  The sniper’s sharp shooting frees Nathan and Karen, and they flee to the CN Tower’s roof, from where the shots are coming.  Kozlow and Becker give chase, but Nathan and Karen get to the top of the tower, where the MASKED SNIPER tells Nathan he’s his FATHER, the Locust.  Suddenly the Locust is shot by Kozlow and falls over the roof’s edge.  

Rather than kill Kozlow, Nathan cuffs him and leaves him for the police.  Then he flees, 
determined to be on his own.  The authorities capture Kozlow, and later Wesley discovers that he’s been under intense surveillance as well and is apprehended for his betrayal of Nathan’s whereabouts.   Boyer learns that Shapiro, the arson expert, was not really with the US Marshals, and at that moment he gets a call on the special “red phone.”  It is MARTIN, aka Shapiro, Nathan’s true father, the Locust (and who posed as Jack Shapiro).  

Martin/The Locust dresses his wound while chastising Boyer for allowing Nathan to be exposed to such danger.  CUT TO Nathan, with no one to go to and nowhere to turn, returns to the Old Man’s instructions tracks down RASMUS in Modesto.  Rasmus turns out to be the man posing as Shapiro’s arson associate (but whom Nathan never saw).  Rasmus admits that that is his name, but tells Nathan he has the wrong house; he knows nothing of the boy, his predicament, or the answers to his questions.  Rasmus returns to dinner with his lovely family.  

In the final scene, Nathan waits by himself at a lonely bus stop in the middle of the desert.  Rasmus drives by, stops, and tells the boy to get in.

COMMENTS
A standard-issue animated family film that hits all the usual marks, character-wise, plot-wise, beat-wise – and as a result, comes across as fairly generic and unexciting, despite several strong set-pieces.  The chief problem is the defiantly old-fashioned nature of the project – coming after the innovations of Pixar and the whole self-aware post-SHREK attitude of animated entertainment, a story like this – one that doesn’t try anything out of the ordinary, in any way – feels strangely dated, more like a direct-to-video Disney knockoff than a fresh new vision.

STEVE COMMENTS - Far cry from the originality of top level animation projects (think Brad Bird).  Sure to be pricey as well, this is decent family fare but not an amazing script.  The characters are charming, the story alright, but my hopes were higher.  Nothing really negative to say about it other than it could have been much more clever and imaginative. Mixed for popcorn. Poporn B or C. 

SUMMARY
Jasper Park, Canada.  Four “omega” teenage wolves – HUMPHREY (the leader), SALTY (the “dude” type), MOOCH (chubby), and SHAKEY (smart) – try to slalom a log down a hill, only to nearly collide with KATE, a girl wolf who’s about to leave for “alpha wolf” school for the winter.  Humphrey is clearly attracted to her.
The following spring, Kate returns.  Humphrey watches her, mesmerized, as she saves rival “eastern pack” wolves SCAR and CLAWS from being trampled during a caribou hunt.  He is warned by his friends that he can’t have her – she’s an alpha now, and he’s an omega, which makes any relationship illegal.  At home, Kate’s father, WINSTON, bemoans their lack of food due to eastern raids.  One of their hunters, CAN-DO, is brought in with injuries; Winston and his wife, EVE, call for the alphas to be placed on alert.
Winston confronts TONY, the eastern pack leader, who reminds him of their plans to unite the packs by marrying Kate to Tony’s alpha son, GARTH, who Kate’s younger sister, LILLY, worships.  To avoid a war for the remaining caribou, Winston agrees.  Humphrey is heartsick, but Kate feigns interest in Garth, despite his irritating, jock-ish nature.  Only moments after a disastrous first date with Garth, however, Kate and Humphrey are tranquilized by PARK RANGERS involved in a wolf relocation program…and transported to Sawtooth, a wildlife preserve in Idaho.
Upon being set loose, Kate and Humphrey enlist the help of a golf-obsessed goose, MARCEL, and duck, PADDY, to find out the truth: they’ve been relocated to populate the park with baby wolves.  Meanwhile, back in Jasper, Lilly puts the moves on Garth as tensions build between the wolf packs.
Kate and Humphrey sneak a ride in the camper of GARN and DEBBIE, two park visitors on their way to Jasper; Marcel and Paddy fly overhead.  Then, at a truck stop, Humphrey tries to retrieve cupcakes from a trash can and is nearly shot by the owner.  Kate saves him; they flee into the woods.  Marcel and Paddy catch up to them and suggest they catch a ride on the Canadian Express train.  As they head off to find it, up in Jasper, Scar and Claws spy on Garth and Lilly and plot…
Upon nearing the train, Humphrey accidentally pisses off a group of BEARS; he and Kate barely escape by falling through a ravine onto a glacier, where Humphrey saves her life with his slalom skills.  They make it onto the train, and fall for each other on the trip; meanwhile, Tony catches Garth with Lilly, and declares war on Winston’s wolf pack.
The train arrives in Jasper Park.  Before Humphrey can declare his love for Kate, they come upon the brewing conflict between the packs.  Kate declares her intention to marry Garth and restore peace.  Humphrey is crushed and decides to leave Jasper.
During the wedding ceremony, Kate declares she can’t marry Garth, for she is in love with Humphrey, an omega.  Garth declares that he, too, loves an omega – Lilly.  Tony rejects this; a fight breaks out, which is interrupted by a caribou stampede.  Humphrey returns, and with Kate’s help, utilizes his log-racing skills to save Tony and Winston from the oncoming herd.
Kate and Humphrey are allowed to marry, as are Garth and Lilly.  Winston and Tony befriend Marcel and Paddy.  Kate and

Three co-workers end up in a desperate fight for survival when they become trapped by a psychotic killer.
 
COMMENTS 
Not a huge fan of this project; (and I wasn’t a huge fan of BURIED either… but that script may actually have been better). The killer has absolutely no reason for doing this; so we basically watch a random act of violence unfold for the course of ninety minutes.  The premise seems contrived; the criminal seems to inexplicably possess super powers, and the main characters don’t really come up with any really smart or interesting ways to get out of their situation.   This is trying to capture the style of OPEN WATER in an ATM vestibule, and it doesn’t work very well. 
 
SUMMARY 
DAVID, bored at work, reluctantly agrees to come to the office xmas party when his  buddy COREY tells him that his longtime crush EMILY will be there. 
 
At the bar, David has an awkward conversation with her but manages to talk her into letting him drive her home.  Much to his chagrin, the inebriated Corey demands to get a ride home as well; and on the way insist they stop at an ATM so he can get some food. 
 
Corey doesn’t have enough cash in his account, so David and Emily join him in an ATM vestibule. It’s one am, and the parking lot surrounding the ATM is abandoned, until a terrifying, huge MAN in a parka stands outside the vestibule; staring at them. Emily gets freaked out; but Corey insists they’re overreacting; until someone else a MAN WITH A DOG, walks up and the MAN kills him, right in front of them.   They all freak out; but none of them have a cellphone. 
 
David tries to run to their car to grab Emily’s phone, but the man breaks through the window, pulls him out and starts beating him.  David manages to make it back into the ATM vestibule; but they know they’re not really safe in there: the lock on the door is broken, but the MAN doesn’t realize it yet. 
 
To make matters worse; they all seem to be suffering from early stages of hypothermia. 
 
They manage to get a security guard’s attention, but he gets killed by the MAN; who smashes his head in with a tire iron.  
 
They are so cold they start to hallucinate a bit; but jump into action when the Man with the Parka bursts into the vestibule. David and Corey attack him and get the upperhand, choking him to death with the wire that attaches the pen to the Atm.  Emily shrieks; realizing THE MAN is still outside; David and Corey killed an innocent man.
 
Corey, fed up, makes a break for it but the man easily catches him and attacks stabbing him in the gut with a screwdriver. 
 
Corey barely survives, and David and Emily run outside to help him get back into the vestibule. 
 
The MAN rolls David’s car in front of the ATM, blocking the door and effectively trapping them inside.  He then pulls a hose to an opening and pours in freezing cold water. 
 
Emily and David start a fire, using deposit slips and the dead man’s lighter; which sets off the sprinklers and an alarm. The man crashes the security guards car into the atm, destroying the glass and injuring Emily; who bashes her head and dies. 
 
David grabs a tequila bottle and makes a Molotov cocktail; burning the MAN alive, but is surprised to see the man doesn’t move an inch; David was tricked and accidentally burned the dead body of the security guard.  Cops arrive and THE MAN disappears. David is arrested for all the murders; and the security camera footage supports the theory, because the man never came within range of the camera.

CAST: Sean Astin, Beto Cuevas, Rider Strong
STATUS:
GENRE: Horror/Thriller

LOGLINE: Three high school graduates travel to a Mexican border town looking for fun, but find themselves hunted by a bloodthirsty band of Palo Malobe cultists

SUMMARY:  

In a run down section of Mexico City, two detectives: ULISES BARRERO and ZOILO CRUZ raid the home of SANTILLAN, a renowned witch, only to be taken prisoner by two of his followers GUSTAVO and LUIS. Ulises is made to watch as Zoilo is Tortured and murdered, a warning to all those who oppose Santillan. 

Back in Galveston Texas, three recent High School graduates enjoy their last hurrah before heading off to business school.  They are: ED, a cool headed idealist, Henry, a right-wing frat boy type and PHIL, a sensitive preacher’s son.  The next morning, the three get into their SUV and head over the border to Matanzas, a seedy border town, determined to get Phil laid for the first time.  The three stop at a strip club, where Henry pays for Phil to sleep with AMELIA, a teenage hooker.  They head back to her bedroom, but when Phil hears Amelia’s baby crying in the background, he can’t go through with the sex.  Back at the bar, Ed spots a DRUNK harassing the beautiful bartender VALERIA.  He intervenes, but the drunk slashes him with a knife.  Valeria treats the wound.  Ed manages to charm her and asks her out for the night. She agrees.

Ed, Henry and Phil leave with Valeria.  She brings her cousin Lupe, a Santeria worshipper, whom Henry starts to hit on, despite her objections. Feeling like the odd man out, Phil leaves, saying that he wants to go visit Amelia.  He wanders down a dark alleyway, where he’s kidnapped and driven off by Gustavo and MARIO, his teenage cohort.  

Henry follows Lupe through a graveyard where they find evidence of occult worship, while Ed and Valeria have wild sex.  Ed and Henry wake up the next morning, figuring Phil slept over at Amelia’s.  At breakfast, Ed talks about how he’s not going to business school, instead he’s going to join an international relief group that works in Africa. Henry mocks him for being weak.  Ed and Henry look for Phil at Amelia’s house, but he’s not there.  

Phil wakes up handcuffed to a chair in a wooden shed.  RANDALL, an American outlaw gives Phil food and water, telling him that he’s part of “Papa’s big plan”.  Phil will be used as a spiritual vessel to communicate with the dead: he’s going to be sacrificed.

Ed and Henry report Phil’s disappearance to the police.  While they’re waiting, Ulises arrives, telling CHIEF RAMRIZEZ that he has evidence of a major drug smuggling/occultist ring in Mantanzas.  Ramirez dismisses Ulises, telling him to go back to Mexico City.  Ed and Henry leave the station, hopeless that they’ll get any help. Henry waits at the Hotel, while Ed and Valeria search the streets for Phil.  They happen upon a memorial service for people “taken by the dark ones”.  Gustavo and Luis drive up, telling Ed to forget about his missing friend and go back to the U.S.

Phil escapes from the shed, discovering that he’s in the middle of a cult compound strewn with body parts and corpses. Before he can escape, Randall and GHOST RIDER, a horseman in white makeup, catch him.  Ulises watches with binoculars as Phil is taken back to the shed and SANTILLAN, (A.K.A. Papa) arrives at the camp, greeting his lover/high priestess ANNA.   

Ed, Henry and Valeria meet Lupe at her Santeria shop.  Lupe reveals that that there have been abductions in Matanzas by Palo Molobe worshippers: an evil offshoot of Santeria, In order to make “good magic” with the gods, the have to sacrifice a gringo: Phil.  Henry notices that Gustavo and Luis watching them.  Fed Up, Henry charges them down with a crowbar.  Gustavo shoots Henry through the neck.  When Ed rushes in to help his friend, Gustavo tries to kill him but the gun mysteriously jams.  Gustavo and Luis flee the scene.  

Henry is treated at the hospital for his wound.  Ed refuses to leave, saying that they have to find Phil.  Ulises arrives, telling them that he knows where Phil is.  He explains to them that Santillan is a powerful witch/druglord, who is going to commit a blood sacrifice in order to make his trucks invisible to the police.  Ulises says that the police in Matanzas are worthless, and that he’ll try to rescue Phil on his own.

Lupe returns to her apartment and is attacked by Luis.  Back at the compound, Santillan meets Phil, telling him about the special plan to make good magic with the Gods.  Anna starts shaving Phil’s head with a knife.

Ed and Valeria go to Lupe’s home, discovering that she’s been decapitated and fitted with a goat’s head.  Back at the hotel, the power goes out.  Henry wanders into the lobby and is chased down by cult members, who hack him to death with a machete.

Ed and Valeria return to the hotel, where Ramirez and the police say they’ve found drugs in Ed and Henry’s room.  Before the police can apprehend Ed,  Ulises arrives, accusing Ramirez of taking bribes from Santillan.  He takes, Ramirez hostage escaping from the hotel with Ed.  Ed, Valeria and Ulises drive with Valeria to the cult compound.  Ulises arms himself with a shotgun and pistol, telling Ed and Valeria that he’s going to go rescue Phil on his own.  He tells Ed and Valeria to wait outside, giving them a bag of evidence to take to the FBI if he doesn’t survive.  

Inside the compound, the ritual begins.  Phil begs for his life.  Anna orders that he be gagged.  Santillan slashes his Achilles tendon, bites off his tongue and decapitates him.

Ulises sneaks on to the compound.  Ghost Rider attacks him.  Ed and Valeria speed into the compound, helping Ulises kill Ghost Rider.  They sneak into the main house, discovering Phil’s decapitated head.  Ulises sneaks up on Santillan, but Santillan suprises him, shooting him in the stomach.  Wounded, Ulises manages to gun Santillan down with a hidden pistol. Panic breaks out on the compound.  

Ed and Valeria help Ulises escape in a stolen van, taking refuge at an old Farmer’s house only a few miles away from the U.S. border.  Ulises dies from his wounds.  Randall, Mario and the rest of the cultists surround the farmhouse.  Ed and Valeria barricade the door, arming themselves with Ulises’ shotgun and pistol.  An intense firefight ensues.  Randall and Mario break into the house by driving a tractor through the front door.  Ammo exhausted, Ed manages to hack Randall and Mario to death with a machete.

Leaving the carnage behind, Ed and Valeria hike to the Rio Grande, carrying Ulises bag of evidence with them.  Washing the blood from their hands, they watch the sun rise over the border, scarred by a horrible ordeal, 


COMMENTS:

A mindless, sloppy retread of a seemingly spent genre.  While this script has the opportunity to become an intriguing exploration of the mysterious world of occultism ala The Serpent and the Rainbow, it veers into stock slasher territory, where the potential for an original Santerian world are pushed aside for wanton gore and a Dawn of the Dead style action.  The seemingly central goal of the story is that Ed and Henry rescue their friend, but this is completely abandoned when Phil is ritualistically murdered, leaving the plot in chaos.  Because the characters are never truly established, we have no idea why they do what they do, or any reason to care about their survival.  Ed’s relief worker speech seems like a clumsy way to tack humanism to his character, while Valeria has no plausible reason to risk her life to aid a bunch of rich gringos in their quest the rescue their friend from bloodthirsty cultists.  In addition, the script seems anchored in a disturbing xenophobic/racist mentality that the third world is a viper pit of primitive savagery.  This is a solid pass.

COMMENTS:
This is a far fetched rendition of classical Greek figures. Structurally, the story develops very slowly with a verbose narrative of a long-winded back story of the characters and setting. Once the story begins, the pace picks up and an action filled film takes over. The plot is a bit muddled for the first act, but the second and third acts somehow manage to come together. The main problem with this script is that the writing isn’t very good, the dialogue is routine and we have a difficult time cheering for the main character, Theseus. It doesn’t help that Theseus dies after defeating the barbarian king as we’re left with little satisfaction as to what we’ve just seen. Greek tragedies usually have bittersweet endings, but, more often than not, we care about the hero before they meet their terrible fate.  

SM COMMENTS
The only drawback in my mind is the high prices.  Script is exhilarating. It's a clear follow up to 300,  will be directed by Tarsem Singh, so the visuals are sure to be strong, but the script doesn't have the same weird edge you'd associate with him.  It's a fast paced action, set in Grecian times, the battle scenes are well drawn, the hero's quest is thrilling, the climactic scene between the Gods, Titans, Humans and Barbarians has the potential to be absurdly cool.  A List Popcorn, but the price is super high, and its not a cast driven thing. 

SUMMARY:

	A WOMAN tells a young child about the birth of earth and how the Gods created the forces of good and evil, Gods versus the Titans. The Titans were banished into Mount Tartaros to be exiled forever. Zeus and the Greek Gods created ‘man’ to populate earth and have free will to exist. The remaining forces of evil are led by a BARBARIAN KING who challenges humanity. It’s a test by Zeus to see if mankind worthy and loyal to him. 
	The Bow of Cryptos is a formidable weapon that’s hidden by Zeus with hope that the prophet warrior, THESEUS, will find it and use the mighty power of the bow to save mankind. The Barbarian King wants to possess it in order to use it to overwhelmingly destroy the humans that oppose him and enslave the rest. The race to obtain the mythical weapon causes KING PETROS and the Barbarian King to clash every step of the way. 
	In a small mountainside village, Theseus and his mother, SOPHIA, are commoners being oppressed by the locals who claim they curse their village. It’s not clear how or why they are so hated but things come to a crashing head when King Petros arrives to protect the villagers from the Barbarian King. Disguised as an OLD MAN, Zeus tries to guide Theseus to his destiny. 

Theseus, however, is bitter and doesn’t believe in the myths about the Bow of Cryptos or any destiny that will change the fate of mankind. He’s a ferocious warrior with no faith.
	When King Petros proclaims that he’ll protect the villagers, but they have to move into his fortress on the Walls of Mt. Tartaros. The villagers will go and join forces with the Petros but Theseus and his mother must stay behind. Angry, Theseus refuses to join the villagers anyway. Unfortunately, after the king’s Hoplite men leave, the barbarians attack and kill Sophia with the villagers who didn’t leave. Her dying words to Theseus are for him to fulfill his destiny and find his royal father. Confused and wanting revenge, Theseus sets out to kill the Barbarian King. 
	Along the way, Theseus is captured by the Barbarian King and made a slave on a ship where he meets other captives including the beautiful DESPINA. She’s one of many enslaved women who are suspected of being an oracle. The Barbarian King wants to use the oracles’ powers to enhance his own. While being a slave on the ship, Theseus escapes with a band of men and is told by the Old Man that in order to defeat the Barbarian King, he must find the Bow of Cryptus after saving the oracle. Despina turns out to be the oracle and joins Theseus’ men on their journey. The men consist of; MEGALLOS, STELLIOS, NIKOS, HERON, and his followers.  
	Theseus and Despina fall in love along the way. All during the story, Zeus is urged by his godly assistants, ATHENA, ARIES, HELIOS and POSEIDON, to help the humans. The barbarians outnumber them as innocent humans are repeatedly defeated and massacred. Zeus doesn’t want to interfere beyond enlightening him. Theseus and his band win several small skirmishes before they find the Bow of Cryptos. Feeling empowered, Theseus and his men are warned by Despina not to avenge the murders of a monk monastery, but Theseus doesn’t listen. As a result of attacking the barbarians, they fall into a trap and lose the Bow to the Barbarian King.
	The Barbarian King gathers his army and assaults King Petros’ kingdom at Mt. Tartaros. Theseus and his followers join the king and, at the same time, discover that King Petros is his long lost father. They counter attack the barbarians while trying to retrieve the bow. King Petros is killed in the battle and Theseus assumes the throne. The barbarians begin to over run the humans as the walls of Tartaros crumble from the power of the bow. The evil Titans are freed from their dormant captivity. 
	Zeus and his gods finally join the fray. It’s a vicious fight and there are heavy loses on both sides. Theseus challenges the Barbarian King to a one on one hand to hand combat. The winner will decide the fate of the earth. The Barbarian King agrees and the two fight to the death. Theseus defeats the Barbarian King, but dies from his wounds. Mankind is saved. The woman narrator turns out to be Despina and the child is her son fathered by Theseus.

COMMENTS 
A bit too long and, incongruously, some of the emotional moments towards the end felt a bit rushed and superfluous: namely SAM’s resurrection - his return to faith, his phone call to his daughter and Deng’s request to be baptized.  Otherwise, it’s a truly unique story with several emotional moments. The writing is powerful; at the outset I was afraid that it was going to be overwrought, but the tone is consistent in its extremity and it’s an effect that works. It’s inspiring without being TOO overly preachy, its action packed and moving. It has a lot of religious imagery, but doesn’t get overly bogged down by it; this could be a very cool movie and I’m interested to watch it. Would prefer Russell Crowe in the role as I’ve not seen Butler really pull off anything this emotional.  Interesting project, definitely worth reading and considering. 

SUMMARY
WILLIAM dragged out of hut by LRA and forced to kill his mother; we go to black as he makes his fateful decision.

SAM CHILDRESS is let out of prison and has sex with his wife LYNN in their car.  Sam is annoyed to find out she’s quit smoking cigarettes, and enraged when he finds out she’s quit stripping. “You’re a fucking junkie whore!” he insists, but she tells him that she’s found God. 

SAM and his buddy DELANE bust into a crack den and steal the crack and cash from some junkies; SAM flips out and nearly kills one of them but Delane pulls him back from the brink.  

The two, hopped up and high on adrenaline and stolen drugs, pick up a drifter who pulls a knife on Delane. SAM beats up the drifter, steals the knife and stabs the guy to death.  He comes home and LYNN finds him with blood on his hands… SAM is desperate and realizes that he needs help.  

LYNN takes Sam to get baptized.  He begins life as an honest man and tries to play the role of breadwinner to provide for his wife and their young daughter PAIGE, but work is hard to come by and he nearly returns to a life of crime. A storm blows through and almost destroys their trailer but when the dust settles Sam gets a ton of work in construction, repairing all the damage. He starts his own roofing company and is able to buy a nice house with comfy amenities.  

Sam is moved by a priest from Africa who describes troubles in the war-torn Sudan. Sam decides to go on a volunteer mission.  Sam is shocked by the violence and devastation; and vows to make saving the children of the Sudan his life’s work. 

Sam builds a small church in his hometown and begins preaching; “that’s the first time I can remember God saving my ass…” He also vows to build an orphanage in the Sudan. 

Sam, with the help of a few Sudanese SPLA fighters (freedom fighters) including DENG (“sam means small penis!”) and PETER, build an orphanage and a church in the middle of the war zone; but rebels attack and raze the entire village. Sam and the others hold off the rebels with a machine gun, but the place is destroyed. Sam wants to quit but LYNN gives him the courage and strength to press on and rebuild the orphanage. 

Sam becomes known across the land as the WHITE PREACHER; and takes weapons in his hand to battle rebels, nearly getting killed in the process. 

Things at home are tough; money is tight and LYNN is frustrated with Sam’s focus on Africa while she can hardly make the mortgage.   In Africa, SAM is invited by the leader of the SPLA, JOHN DARANG, to join him at the peace talks as a guest. 

SAM continues fighting to protect the children, including killing a sniper who’d been trying to shoot him. Sam is warned that he is being viewed as a mercenary and that the rebels have put a bounty on his head. 

Sam goes on a rescue mission to save kids being taken by the LRA.  They only have room for about half the kids, and Sam has to make the heartbreaking decision to choose which he thinks need the most urgent care, promising to return for the others. By the time he gets back, the LRA have killed the other children. 

Back at home, Sam is heading into a dark place… he erupts at church, bellowing violently that “god does not want sheep he wants warriors!” he erupts at his wife and daughter, “you ain’t pissing money away on a limo!” and he erupts at his longtime friend, reformed junky Delane “you ain’t nothing but a stray dog round here!” Finally, he explodes in a bar fight after a biker calls him a “nigger fucker.”  Sam, covered in blood, winds up in a jail cell and it looks like the old Sam is back. The Sam “with a death wish.” 

Delane dies. 

Sam hits rock bottom. He tells the congregation that there is no God. He sells his construction business.  Lynn stands up to him and demands that he fight for her and for Paige. “There’s nothing left to give!” 

Sam goes back to Africa and looks like a killing machine. The kids and his men are all scared of him. He finds redemption when young WILLIAM (the boy who was forced to kill his mother in the opening scene) tells him to refuse to let the rebels steal his “heart.” Deng asks to be baptized. Sam calls his daughter and tells her that he loves her. 

Sam saves WILLIAM and his brother by being transported by the LRA to ED DUIM (a  slave market). 

“To this day, Sam Childers fights for the children of Sudan and Northern Uganda.”

2ND COVERAGE OF MACHINE GUN PREACHER

LOGLINE
 A devout Christian does what no government, statesman, diplomat or community activist has done: he risks his life to rescue and care for Ugandan orphans caught in a civil war and ignored by their country and the world in the midst of a brutal humanitarian crisis. 
 
COMMENTS
A riveting drama-slash-tract without a protective remove. It devolves from a gripping story into a shaming, over-wrought rant. The story speaks for itself to moviegoers who are neither lazy nor lacking in compassion. 
Upside: An amazing story. Commercial prospects are good but not great; it’s intensely disturbing, but it’s also great drama infused with hope. It is graphic and purposely disturbing, but the central character is courageous and uplifting. Ultimately, a satisfying story but a risky buy. It pushes you to move beyond your comfort zone; buy it only you know if your audience is ready. Overall, I suggest giving MACHINE GUN PREACHER serious consideration, especially if it can made at a decent price. ‘Hotel Rwanda’ cost $17 million and made more than that in the US alone. So MACHINE GUN PREACHER has news value and a great marketing propeller behind it. Moreover, it could really be a force for change and meaningful good in the world 
Downside: Script is too long; the set-up is unnecessarily drawn out, and the final conflict comes 20 pages too late. Its tone is unrelenting; there is only so much cruelty and grief a paying audience can be expected to sit through, and this script bangs the drum so loudly it threatens to drive viewers under their seats. In addition to these small structural weaknesses, the script’s narrative is derailed at the end of the second act. 

MW COMMENTS 
The character of Sam Childers is well developed. His back ground makes sense. The heavy drug and violence he was struggling with in the beginning of the film makes sense for what is to come. 

A film in a setting of Hotel Rwanda, Shooting dogs. The difference is that this one has a major action star who also is using his gun. But this is no action movie. It is a sad story about the unfair wars in Africa and cruelties that take place there. This film has no genre, nor a good arch nor plan. It feels like a bunch of incidents. The Machine Gun Preacher really has no plan, so as an audience you feel lost. Everyone wants to know the plan, the mission. What are we doing? It feels as if the Preacher is just reacting to the rebels, and in the movie we see all his anecdotes of what has happened to him. The plot is all over the place and I would be surprised if audiences are excited to see this. Academy awards would help, but I wouldn't bet on that. The chance is not big the movie will get that far.  

SUMMARY
Act I - OPEN in Sudan, where five men with machine guns ride across the desert in an SUV. The driver is a black man in ragged fatigues: DENGA. In the back, SAM CHILDERS polishes bullets and then jams them into his gun. Suddenly, their SUV is attacked by LRA REBELS in a Jeep. A firefight erupts, and Sam shows admirable courage. But after one brutal explosion, Sam is left flat on his back, staring into space as a boy, FRANCIS, stands above him holding a smoking machine gun.

Nine years earlier. Southeastern Pennsylvania. Sam emerges from prison, and is met by his wife LYNN. They return home to their mobile home, where their little daughter PAIGE waits with her grandma, Sam’s mother, DAISY. Sam is furious to learn that Lynn has stopped stripping for a living; she has kicked drugs and become more devout. She now has a more respectable nine-to-five. Sam goes to a bar where his old buddies hang out; he gets drunk and does drugs with his buddy DELANE. Lynn goes to church but not Sam. Then one night, Sam and Delane rob their cocaine dealer. They get drunk and high and are speeding along the freeway when they come upon a HITCHHIKER. They pick him up but the Hitchhiker pulls a knife; Sam ends up stabbing the Hitchhiker six times and dumping him by the side of the road. He returns to the trailer covered in blood and begs Lynn to help him clean up.

Shaken by the incident, Sam begins to change. He stops drinking and using drugs. He goes to church with Lynn. He spends more time with Paige. But the fact that he can’t get a job, can’t support his family, is crushing him. Then comes a tornado, and Sam protects Lynn and Paige. When the storm passes, there is lots of work to be done rebuilding homes. Sam does so well that he is able to buy a used truck ‘ and a two bedroom home. Things are really going well for them, and they are stable and happy. 

One day at church, a white South African PREACHER tells the congregation about Christians in Africa that desperately need their help. Sam mulls over the idea of traveling there and ‘doing some good for someone else’ for a change.

CUT TO Uganda, where Sam helps rebuild schools. Machine-gun armed SPLA SOLDIERS stand around the construction site, including Deng from the opening scene. Later, as Sam rests in his dorm, he asks Deng to show him some of the countryside. He does; they stop at a Ugandan refugee camp of 20,000 people living in the open, where hopelessness and poverty is overwhelming. Sam helps a doctor in the camp, AGNETE, move a sick patient and learns that the LRA (led by JOSEPH KONY) attacks the Ugandans mercilessly, chopping off limbs, ears, lips. Sam is shaken. He and Deng continue into Sudan. There, Sam is startled to see hundreds of children leaving their camps and villages and heading out into the bush to sleep. It’s safer there, Deng explains. Sam ushers several dozen into his room, but come dawn, he learns that the LRA attacked a village. They hurry there (just ahead of the children) to discover that the village is decimated, the parents all burned to death and stacked outside their huts. A little GIRL weeps over her mother’s corpse while her BROTHER stares, then chases his dog ‘ and is blown to bits by a mine. Sam cradles the dead boy and stares into the heavens.

Back in Pittsburgh, Sam returns to his family a changed man. He draws plans to build a church across the street, and an orphanage in Sudan. Lynn is taken aback, but embraces him. 

Six months later, the church is nearly built. The preacher they booked for their first day of worship doesn’t show up ‘ so, with Daisy’s encouragement and a story about how it was prophesied that he’d be a preacher, Sam gets up on the pulpit and tells his story. He wasn’t up to any good, but the Good Lord, he don’t make trash. He’s got a plan for every one of you, Sam says, and the congregation is hooked.

Sam returns to Sudan. CUT TO the SPLA soldiers from the opening scene shining the new boots Sam has brought them. Then Sam travels to a dangerous part of the country and tells the officials where he wants to build the orphanage: this is the place God has chosen. He tells Lynn via long-distance phone call, not seeing that she is doubled over in pain, and trying to hide it. Sam bonds in friendship with Deng and hires BETTY to care for the kids in the orphanage. Building begins but remains unfinished when LRA Rebels attack. Sam and his men fight back throughout the night and the kids are brought to the brick church in the middle of the compound; in the morning, the children are uninjured but the orphanage is destroyed. Sam doesn’t know how he can go on until Lynn reminds him that the children he is serving have lost much more. So Sam stays and rebuilds.

When another small group of children is brought in, starving and near death, Sam is moved to fury. He grabs his gun and decides to go out to that region and listens to no one trying to stop him. Deng and a few soldiers ride alone ‘ in a continuation of the opening scene. The LRA fighters ‘ including a 10 year old boy named FRANCIS ‘ are eventually overcome, and Francis returns with Sam to the orphanage. Francis asks every boy in the orphanage if he has seen his brother, CHRISTOPHER, and shows him a picture. No one has seen him. That night, the children sing themselves to sleep, and in the morning, Francis follows Sam everywhere.

Sam returns to Pennsylvania and issues a fire-and-brimstone sermon, castigating the faithful for their wealthy, comfortable lives when so many suffer in Africa. God doesn’t care about intentions, he shouts at them, He only cares about actions. Later, alone with her husband, Lynn tells him that they have no more money. They can barely make the house payment. Bill goes to visit a wealthy MEMBER of the community and asks for $5,000 to sustain the orphanage for six months. He is invited to the Member’s posh home but leaves in a huff when he’s given a check for $150.00. He sells all his guns and his beat-up car. 

Back at the orphanage, Sam is visited by JOHN GARANG, the leader of the SPLA, who fight against the LRA Rebels. He admires Sam’s work and invites him to come to a peace summit the following week. Sam does but takes the floor unexpectedly to remind the delegates there that they must make killing their first priority, not the division of resources. He returns to the orphanage and assembles a jungle gym; the kids (and some soldiers) play like kids, laughing. It’s a beautiful sound. Only little Francis remains silent; Sam assumes he can’t speak English and unburdens his heart. His greatest fear is that he will collapse under the strain and leave the orphanage.

Back at home, Delane tucks Paige into bed. Lynn misses Sam more than anything. The next day, Sam spies two BOYS in a ravine. One of his Soldiers goes out to retrieve them and is shot. A SNIPER continues to shoot, even as Sam makes his way to the Boys and discovers that they are chained there: bait. Sam shoots the Sniper ‘ moments later, he realizes the dead Sniper is also a boy, no older than 13. Something in him collapses. Meanwhile back home, Lynn undergoes surgery for diseased ovaries ‘ all alone.

Sam begins to undergo a serious psychic break in which his personality shifts into a kind of catatonic anger. It’s borne from a sense of rage and helplessness, and it begins to inspire fear in the children and Deng. One day, they hear of a convoy of trucks and race out to find dozens of children, some without clothes and bearing infected wounds, stranded in the bush. They were being taken to be sold. Sam fills his SUV with the most acute medical cases and promises to be back for the others within 2 hours. The children wail with grief as he departs. He returns as promised ‘ to find their little burned bodies stacked in a pile, dead, burned alive. 

Sam returns home a broken, angry man. He wants more money for the orphanage but the bank refuses to lend it to him. He lashes out at Delane, who is using again, but Sam can’t see it. He screams at Paige and challenges Lynn. He catches the TV news: John Garang has been killed by LRA Rebels. He is arrested after a bar fight; after bailing him out, Lynn tearfully begs for Sam to return to the family. The emotional cost is too high. But the next morning, Lynn discovers that Sam has sold everything: the old truck, the construction business, and all his tools.

Back in Africa (with a new truck and Francis by his side), Sam is resting at the orphanage when he is summoned to the gate. But the men there are LRA Rebels and begin to shoot. They all survive, but Sam is left with a live grenade in his hand. He plays with the pin; he clearly has a death wish. One of the Rebels is captured, and Francis asks him if he has seen his brother.

Delane places a call to Africa, but Sam doesn’t take it. CUT TO Delane’s funeral. Sam tells the congregation that there no God. He demands to know where the rest of cash is, but Lynn tells him they have none. He drives away, enraged, and she weeps.

Returning to Africa, Sam’s eyes are empty, and he moves through his day in a slow rage. Deng sees it, but is helpless. (Back home, Lynn’s health deteriorates.) One night Sam plays with the grenade and Francis comes to sit beside him. In perfect English, Francis describes how LRA Rebels forced him to bash his mother’s head in to save his life and that of his brother. He dropped the club, but his mother put it back in his hand and told him to make her proud. And so he did. And now he looks everywhere for his brother. Francis simply tells Sam that they must not allow their hearts to be taken, no matter what else is lost.

And this changes Sam, whose soul slowly heals. The children can laugh again. He calls Paige and Lynn back home, and they reconnect.

Then Francis learns that LRA Rebel soldiers are camped nearby. He sneaks out to find his brother but is caught en route and tossed into a cage. One of the boys guarding the cage is his brother, Christopher! The duo sneaks out that night. Meanwhile, Sam learns of Francis’s departure and rushes out to find him. But Christopher and Francis are hunted down like dogs and loaded onto a truck with other children. Deng and Sam find this truck and use their weapons to stop the convoy. The cut the Rebels down and approach the truck to find fifty children in the back ‘ including Francis. This time, Sam sends the worst cases back to the orphanage immediately, but stays with Deng to guard the others until they, too, can be brought to safety.

A final crawl tells us that Sam Childers continues to fight for the children of Uganda and Southern Sudan. Joseph Kony is armed by the Islamic Government of Sudan in a war against the predominantly Christian South. This will continue unless pressure is exerted by the United States. Now you know.

COMMENTS 
There were a lot of genuinely funny moments in this script; but I often found the plotting and some of the dialog to be somewhat snarky and certainly quirky; to the extent that the entire thing felt very over the top.  I get that the writers were trying to create a modern day fable, but the tone rubbed me the wrong way.  The audience for this would be the Wes Anderson, Charlie Kaufman, Michel Gondry type crowd, but I think those audience’s are fairly discerning, and if the style isn’t there to back it up, the film will fall flat. The director’s main credit is FUN WITH DICK AND JANE, which was much more broad than this would have to be to work.   Shia LeBouf has done well recently; but this role has the potential to come across as a sarcastic jerk.  On the other hand, the desperately romantic undertone was my favorite aspect of the script, and easily the best thing going for it. Not a prebuy, but could be interesting down the line.  The direction and performances would have to hit the tone right on the head; which I think makes this a bit too risky. 

SUMMARY 
CHARLIE COUNTRYMAN, beaten and bruised, gets thrown off a bridge to his death after being betrayed by his lover GABI.

FLASHBACK.  A FEW WEEKS EARLIER 

CHARLIE’s mother MARY BAKER is in the hospital, in a coma and dying, and Charlie can’t bear to watch her get killed (the doctor is switching off her breathing apparatus) so he waits in the hall, where his mother comes to him, speaking from beyond the grave.  She tells him that he’s too fearful in his life and urges him to go to Bucharest. “I don’t know why. It seemed specific.” 

Charlie realizes that his girlfriend is cheating on him.  He quits his job as a technical writer (“you totally nailed the save-secure-backup section!) and boards the plane. Charlie talks to a strange man on the plane to Budapest (the stopover before Bucharest); ISTVAN, a Hungarian CUBS fan who happens to die on the plane and he too talks to Charlie from beyond the grave, urging Charlie to please bring his souvenier Cubs hat to his daughter. 

Airport security confiscate the “funny” hat and Charlie is forced to fight for it.  He gets thrown in airport jail for his trouble.  “I need to give Istvan’s daughter this hat you pricks!” 

Charlie succeeds, eventually getting let out of the holding cell and giving the hat to GABI; ISTVAN’s daughter, and the most beautiful girl Charlie has ever seen.  He instantly falls in love.  He also gives her his shirt, because it has her father’s scent on it. 

CHARLIE and GABI follow ISTVAN’s ambulance.  The ambulance crashes and his body falls out, hitting the window of their taxi.  GABI is traumatized.  She rides off in an ambulance with the body, leaving her stuff with Charlie.  Charlie goes on a wild goose chase, finding a gun in her bag, and a cello, which he brings to a local opera house. 

CHARLIE gets arrested and taken to jail for wielding her gun; GABI and her opera director BELA help him get out of jail.  CHARLIE and GABI grow closer, but their budding relationship is quickly thwarted by NIGEL, her psychotic ex husband.  GABI tells NIGEL that Charlie is gay. 

CHARLIE goes to a hostel. He gets high on ecstasy with his two new roommates, LUC and KARL, and sees GABI at a club;  she tells him that he has to stay away from her because NIGEL is dangerous.  CHARLIE chases after her and gets hit by a car. 

LUC and KARL take CHARLIE to a strip club so that KARL can work off a boner he got from excessively taking Viagra. They run up a massive bill which they have no means to pay; but CHARLIE manages to negotiate with the clubs seedy manager DARKO – who agrees to forgive their bill if Charlie tells him where to find NIGEL. 

BELA takes CHARLIE to a party where he finds GABI who’s drunk, and she kisses him.  NIGEL shows up at the party; he’s there because he has “unfinished business” with Gabi’s father.  GABI pulls a gun and makes him leave. 

CHARLIE takes her to a room in the hostel and they have sex. In the morning he finds that LUC and KARL have been crazy glued together. 

“Today is the day the boy will die.” 

Charlie, running from DARKO, goes to GABI’s place where he gets caught by NIGEL.  Nigel tortures him and nearly kills him but Charlie gets saved by his CABBIE. CHARLIE runs again, getting caught this time by DARKO. 

GABI gets him out and gives him a train to Bucharest; telling him that he’s been nothing but a “wind of shit” in her life.  Charlie insists that she’s doing an “old yeller,” trying to be mean to him so he leaves, despite the fact that she still loves him. 

Charlie returns and stands up to Nicel but gets badly beaten up.  He gets taken to the bridge, as in the opening of the film.  He gets shot and falls in the water but survives “reborn.” He reunites with Gabi in Bucharest; happy ever after, presumably.

MW COMMENTS 
A good director, a good cast, a good writer, amusing dialogue and characters. Cute funny British details. The setting is very visual and many audiences can relate. Nature combined with love, combined with East versus West. It is a smart way to handle the current state of the world. But the level of pricing does not reflect the level of this project. This is supposed to be an medium priced film, and hopefully you'd make a few bucks. But it's priced like it has no risk whatsoever. Prices like it has already won the Oscar. Priced like it has Julia Roberts and Brad Pitt in the lead. The script is nice, but no matter what, I feel I will put you all out of business if I suggest you buy the film and the roulette ball falls on black rather than red.

SUMMARY 
Dr. Alfred Jones feels at odds with his orderly life as a London fisheries scientist and husband to the career-driven Mary, with whom he shares a coldly dispassionate relationship. Just as Mary departs for a protracted assignment in Geneva, Alfred gets consulted on a visionary sheik's scheme to introduce salmon, and salmon-angling, to the country of Yemen. Alfred is deeply skeptical (salmon are cold-water fish that spawn in fresh water; Yemen is hot and largely desert), but the project gains traction when Peter Maxwell, the prime minister's director of communications, seizes on it as a PR antidote to negative press related to the Iraq war. Alfred is pressed by his superiors to meet with the sheik's real estate rep, the glamorous young Harriet, and embarks on a yearlong journey to realize the sheik's vision of spiritual peace through fly-fishing for the people of Yemen. British businessman and angler Torday captures Alfred's emerging humanity, Maxwell's antic solipsism, Mary's calculating neediness and Harriet's vulnerability, presenting their voices through diaries, e-mails, letters and official interviews conducted after the doomed venture's surprisingly tragic outcome.

Killings, bribes, shakedowns -- it is all in a day's work for David Klein (Butler), a Lieutenant in the Los Angeles Police Department.

COMMENTS
Crackling dialog, great characters, tough guy lead role in the vein of Russel Crowe’s breakthough from LA Confidential; indeed, this entire project reads like LA Confidential redux… problem is, will Carnahan pull it off? And Butler has spend the last few years proving that he’s no Russell Crowe.  I like the script and I love this genre, but don’t think this will quite capture the magic of LA Confidential; and presumably will be quite pricey.  Good script, interesting project, solid consider, but definitely with reservations.  Filling up the cast with interesting people would really make a difference, there are a ton of small, interesting roles, and the lead femme fatale will be crucial as well.  B plus. Popcorn.

SUMMARY
1983. A man with a broken face stares in the mirror. “I killed innocent men.”

FLASHBACK: 1958. “I’m LT David Klein. That’s what my face looked like before.”

KLEIN and his green 26 year old partner, JUNIOR SIMMONS arrest two boxers, RUEBEN RUIZ & SANDERLINE and yank them out of a fighting arena only moments before NOONAN, a “day late and dollar short” FBI agent comes in looking to find them.

They bring the two fighters to a hotel room where they accuse them of planning to turn stool pigeon to the FBI; a mobster calls and tells KLEIN to toss the “spade” out the window. Klein obliges and Sanderline falls to his death. “Remember where you live,” Klein warns Ruiz.

Klein’s boss BRADLEY is furious with him and thinks that NOONAN is gonna turn his sights from the corruption in the boxing world to the corruption in the LAPD.  Bradley accuses him of being tied to the mob.  Bradley threatens Klein and blackmails him into getting rid of a city council candidate.

Klein enlists the help of his sister’s boyfriend PETE BONDARANT; and Junior tags along as they go to take the councilman DISKANT out of the picture. PETE punches the politician in the face; they take Diskant to a hotel room and force him to take nude pictures with a queer; and use the pix as blackmail to make him drop out of the race.

Klein gets assigned by Bradley to investigate a missing person; the Narcotics departments informant… Klein realizes that his throwing Sanderline out the window opened a can of worms and now “the LAPD’s sanctioned dope pusher” has disappeared.

HECTOR MAGDALENA is gone; blood at his house, his wife and daughter upset, his Dobermans’ dead… son TOMMY is the top suspect.  Klein goes in search of Tommy… he digs up more dirt on Hector, some claim he was whoring out his own daughter.  Tommy’s got a violent history, but word on the street is he may not be the man for the murder.

Klein gets another gig moonlighting as a thug for Howard Hughes; gets paid 10g to mess up a disloyal actress’ career… and the actress turns out to be a beauty; and one that Klein holds a candle for… “this doesn’t happen. Not in LA. This is cupid firing his whole fucking quiver.”  He overhears the actress, GLENDA getting prepped to be fake kidnapped as a publicity stunt.

He heads to Magdalena’s house where he sees LUCILLE stripping for a peeping tom; chases the peeping tom and gets hit in the head. NOONAN and the feds squeal up while he’s opening fire on the peeping tom; they hit him with the car and knock him out, but not before Klein accidentally tips them off that they’re chasing Magdalena’s trail.

Klein gets a tip about Tommy Magdalena and finds him at a hophouse in hollywod; Magdalena opens fire and yells something incriminating about the narco cop WILWHITE, that makes Klein think Wilhite killed  
Hector Magdalena. Tommy squeals away in his car, and a chase ensues.   
A Packard full of narco cops cuts into the action and kills Tommy.   
Klein tries to get some info; “did Wilhite kill your father” but Tommy dies silently.

Klein finds WIlhite at Magdalena’s and accuses him of setting up Tommy’s murder, and accuses him of killing hector. Bradley bursts in, irate, and suspends Klein. “You’re going down. Soon.”

Klein uses his new vacation time to head over to GEORGE AINGE; a lead tied to Glenda.  Junior tags along and gets in on the fight; Klein goes on a rampage and threatens George, who reveals he’s been holding a murder weapon that belonged to Glenda… she’d killed a pimp years ago. Junior is shocked by Klein’s betrayal… “you’re not taking me down with you!” and attacks Klein; choking him into unconsciousness.

Klein hires PETE to trail Junior.  Klein finds Glenda and tells her he’s looking out for her now; sticks her in the secret stash house she was gonna use for the fake kidnapping.

Wilhite gets subpoenad for a corruption case; he kills himself. Klein finds the body. And the subpoena; realizes Bradley is turning the investigation on his own guys… “Why?”  Klein sees a wound on Wilhite and realizes Wilhite was the peeper.  Klein gets a subpoena too… “my fifteen year career just went up in smoke.”

Klein bursts into Junior’s apartment; finds gay magazines, notes saying he wants to turn in Klein to Noonan…but Klein just wants to find Glenda’s murder weapon.

The feds pull up; Junior leading them to his place to retrieve the evidence they’re after but Klein blows the place up with a grenade as PETE peels away with a safe that likely contains the wanted knife… Noonans Fed goons grab Klein.  Klein promises to hand him Bradley on a plate and turn federal witness; Klein gets out and heads to Pete who is struggling to open the safe, so Klein heads to Glenda’s and the two have passionate sex.  Back at Pete’s, the safe is open and Pete is pissed… Junior kept fastidious records and now Pete knows that Klein has been holding out about Glenda.  “People are gonna start lining up to see you bleed pal.”

Klein asks Pete to hide out at Glenda’s and protect her. He tells Bradley he’s onto his plan; Bradley and a city council man were teaming up, buying all the land in the ravine to turn a huge profit when the stadium gets approved… but there’s a missing link; A detective KOENIG was really behind Magdalena’s murder; trying to stop  the land deal before it went down.   Junior stabs Klein with Glenda’s  
knife.  Klein gets the upperhand and kills both of them.

Klein muscles his knowledge for a share of the stadium money; he gets beaten badly by PETE on orders from Hughes. Klein goes on the run, saying a sorrowful goodbye to Glenda, but not before returning the knife and guaranteeing her freedom.

Eddie (Cooper) is a down and out New York writer until he comes into possession of a designer drug that allows him to access the full capacity of his brain.

But Eddie soon discovers that ultimate success comes at a price as mysterious antagonists pursue him and dangers of the amazing new drug emerge.

COMMENTS 
High concept script, executed well, its exciting and seems commercial; Bradley Cooper has gotten a lot of press from The Hangover, but I don’t personally love him; if done poorly this has the potential to wind up like the forgettable TOURIST.  In other markets this may be low B or C popcorn, but so far, its one of the better ones this AFM.    Plot has holes, but it’s a lot of fun throughout, and it will be fun to watch the effects as the drugs take hold and he rises from Schlub to tycoon to president. 


SUMMARY 
EDDIE, a down on his luck writer, loses his girlfriend LINDY (she thinks he’s wasting his life and talent) and is so behind on rent he risks getting thrown out. He is basically a NYC loser, stuck in the midst of thousands of people who “have it all figured out.” To make matters worse, he’s still in love with MELISSA, his ex.  EDDIE coincidentally runs into Melissa’s brother VERNON who gives him an experimental drug, the details of which, Vernon doesn’t really explain; his main selling point being merely that the pill costs 500 bucks. 

The pill works incredibly, EDDIE’s brain is firing on all cylinders; he charms his landlord’s girlfriend with incredibly obscure and useful info, (winds up sleeping with her as a result and finds out that a long lasting erection is a side effect of the pill) he cleans his apartment, doesn’t feel the need to eat or smoke and winds up finally writing dozens of pages of his book.  His agent loves it… but the pill wears off and EDDIE fears he can’t finish. 

He desperately contacts Vernon, but Vern gets killed. The apartment is ransacked, someone came by, clearly looking for the pills. EDDIE searches VERN’s apartment and finds 500 of the pills hidden in the walls.

EDDIE starts doing the pills every day; he turns into a super genius, gets fit, and gets lucky with every woman, “fish in a barrel.”   He finishes his book in 4 days and has his editor chomping at the bit, but EDDIE decides the writer life is a waste and he takes up day trading in the stock market. 

EDDIE’s new career catches fire; after getting startup capitol from a Russian gangster GENNADY, EDDIE makes 3 million dollars in two weeks, he gets a meeting and a job offer from CARL VAN LOON one of the biggest corporate tycoons in the world… he is “crossing a bridge” from his old life to his new one, but there’s a catch (beyond the inevitibilty of the drugs running out….  He starts experiencing a side effect. Time starts jumping ahead. He’s hopping from one place to the next without any recollection of having gone. 

EDDIE gets freaked out by the pills and decides to stop cold turkey.  Without the drugs, he’s dull headed and feeble minded. He botches a meeting with CARL; and sees on the news that during his blackout he may have killed an Italian woman.  He starts investigating, finding VERN’s black book and realizes that many others who have taken the drug are dead or sick. He meets MELISSA his ex; and she looks TERRIBLE; she’s aged awfully. She tells him that she took the drugs and that when she came off them it ruined her physical state, and her attention span, she can barely read… she warns him that he needs to gradually ween himself. “How much were you taking?… A lot!” 

EDDIE starts looking like a junky. He turns to an ex girlfriend LINDY for help, and she is enraged that he’s gotten her caught up in this.  LINDY gets chased by a malevolent man in a trench coat; EDDIE tells her to take a pill to get herself out of the situation; she complies and indeed gets away. EDDIE tells her he loves her, but she decides to leave New York.  

EDDIE starts on the pills again and gets hired by Van Loon. “Two months after starting MDT I Was engineering the biggest corporate merger in history.”  

GENNADY, the crooked Russian gangster comes back threatens to spread word about EDDIE’s illegal activities to his new financial friends and ruin Eddie’s life.  To make matters worse, cops are nosing around about the death of the Italian woman.  EDDIE hires a lawyer.

EDDIE stands to make 45M dollars off the deal; but the morning of the signing, the head of the other company, ATWOOD, doesn’t show up.  His wife comes in and admits that ATWOOD’s dying; EDDIE realizes that ATWOOD was on MDT. 

EDDIE gets called in to a police lineup and his lawyer makes him take off his jacket; EDDIE gets nervous because his jacket has been custom made and contains a secret pocket with his pills in it. Without MDT, EDDIE will die within 24 hrs. 

The lawyer steals the pills and gives them to Atwood.  GENNADY chases EDDIE and demands more pills, but EDDIE is out, in fact; EDDIE is getting sick and is contemplating suicide rather than facing the withdrawal.  EDDIE manages to fight back and kill GENNADY. EDDIE drinks GENNADY’s blood to get a taste of the MDT from his bloodstream. 

Months later, EDDIE has managed to start a team of people who manufacture the drug.  He rises from financial gain to political gain and becomes Senator with his sights set on more.  One day he takes a meeting with STEADMAN, from a pharmaceutical company. STEADMAN knows EDDIE is on MDT; STEADMAN offers more, in return for political favor. “He owns me.” EDDIE agrees.

LOGLINE

Inspired by Erik Weihenmayer (a blind man)’s historic ascent of Mt. Everest, a group of blind Tibetans students join Erik and attempt the trek themselves.

COMMENTS

Without argument, an inspiring movie from start to finish.  Erik and Sabriye (both blind) are great characters in their own different ways, and the children are also a joy to watch.  I did not love the doc, however.  Most of the footage of the children is taken prior to the hike, developing their backstory by interviewing family members who are often shockingly cruel to the kids (one mother calls her blind son worthless).  In one particularly troubling scene, the filmmakers arrange a reunion between Taschi and his parents.  His parents seem happy to see him, but there is an underlying and unaddressed tragedy to this reunion – Taschi’s parents had sold him years prior, essentially left him in the hands of thieves in exchange for a small sum, and now they are acting like that never happened.  This somewhat manipulative sequence really detracted from the tone and focus of  the rest of the film.  I would much preferred to have gotten to know the children by watching them struggling to climb a peak, gleaning their personalities and troubles through footage of the climb rather than interview footage neatly arranged into TV friendly segments.  The only characters we get to know through the climb are the team leaders, and the kids (with the exception of Taschi) seem a bit like an afterthought.  Also, perhaps I’m petty, or missed the point, but damn I was disappointed when they didn’t reach the top.


SUMMARY 

In Tibet, Blindness is a stigma, believed to be a punishment for sins of a past life.  Blind Tibetan children are shown no mercy, ridiculed and threatened on the street, and treated as castaways and disappointments in their own home. 

SABRIYE, a blind German woman, sympathetic to their plight, opens a school for the blind in Tibet and begins educating and more importantly, instilling confidence into these children.  One of the most inspirational lessons that she teaches is about Erik Weihenmayer – a blind mountain climber who made history by climbing the highest peak in the world, Mt. Everest.  

Erik comes to visit the school, and he and Sabriye establish “climbing blind.”   Erik and Sabriye choose six of the blind students, and make it their goal to climb one of the mountains close to Everest’s highest peak.  Erik comes to Tibet with a team of professional climbers and guides, and begins training these poor, blind Tibetans on the basics of climbing. 

Almost instantly, the pros realize that these children are facing more of a struggle than they could possibly have imagined.  None of them know even the most basic climbing skills, and Sabriye immediately begins to worry for their safety, and get cold feet about the expedition.  Erik, however, is stubbornly optimistically, and only concedes that the mountain is “potentially dangerous.”  

When the ascent begins the children are jovial, singing American pop tunes as they march together.   As the journey continues, however, altitude and the demands of the hike mount, and some of the weaker kids fall behind, notably TASCHI a blind street kid who’s incredibly poor status has alienated him from the others.  Taschi is the slowest of the group and the team begins to doubt whether he will make it at all.

As the altitude and dangers increase even more, there is a schism in the team – Erik wants to press on regardless of Taschi’s evident incapability (althought Tashi himself seems gung ho and rarely complains) and Sabriye wants to err on the side of caution and give up.  

When they reach ABC, advanced base camp – three quarters of the way up the mountain and only a mere 300 meters from their goal – it is clear that Taschi and some of the others need to descend.  Two of the girls that are forced to descend prematurely are so sick and disappointed that they look like they are going to vomit, and they cry and scream in protestation.  Eventually Sabriye’s faction wins – voicing the need for team unity over the desire to reach the peak.  Erik is clearly frustrated, but the blind climbers seem just as happy to loll about in the snow at base camp, never having seemed as hell bent on the reaching the peak as Erik.

But Cordes’ power is far-reaching and Oliver is transferred to Jakarta. From the fleeting meeting a affair develops that becomes more and more existential in nature.

Robin Wright (formerly Robin Wright Penn) is a struggling actress who has seen her star fall since her heydey as star of PRINCESS BRIDE and FORREST GUMP. A Hollywood executive offers her her “final” contract: a deal that will make her image, charecteristics and indeed any performance property of the film studio; they will scan her into a computer and digitally create her performances forever. The catch is that she will never actually act again. 

COMMENTS 
Flabbergasting.  The script is packed with interesting ideas and loaded with the potential for an amazing array of live action/ animation imagery and if done well, has the potential to be quite incredible… visually. The storyline, however, is quite muddled, strangely paced and left me feeling as if the writing didn’t manage to successfully bottle the potential of the premise. The script is top heavy; devoting far too many pages to Robin’s relatively uninteresting decision about whether or not to agree to have herself turned into a computer image and the result is that the second half of the script is rushed and crams in a TON of insane information without giving it nearly the amount of focus we’d seen for the setup.  Similarly, the AARON character is given strange, mystical dialog and as the central story line of the script, the Robin/ Aaron plot felt weak. I would have preferred if it were more driven by a love story – and the Dylan/ Robin love story really picked up steam throughout and could have been much more significant.   Very interesting in parts but ultimately disappointing.

SUMMARY
ROBIN WRIGHT’S agent tells her that Paramount has an offer. Robin seems to have frittered away her once promising career; she’s got a troubled son, AARON, with USHER SYNDROME- a degenerative disease that will leave him deaf and possibly blind, and she is concerned about their financial situation. The offer turns out to be a contract to scan Robin and use her computer-generated image to create performances. The catch is that Robin must never act again. 

Robin’s unhappiness grows, and she’s uneasy about the decision. Her mother BETSY makes a surprise visit and tells her that her relationship with her son AARON is unhealthy and urges her to put him on meds. The agent, AL and his new apprentice, “scanning” contractual lawyer STEVE arrive and try to urge Robin to sign the deal. 

Robin eventually starts to come around to the idea, but balks when the studio insists that they get the rights to put her in sci-fi movies. JEFF, the CEO of Paramount promises that the agreement will keep her “forever young.”  She signs the agreement and goes through the scanning procedure. 

20 years later. 

In the future, AARON has gone completely deaf, but technology allows him to communicate with Robin via headsets. In this future, robotics are rampant, the government seems much more imperialistic, and an aging (no early 60s) Robin visits a place called ALHAMBRA, in the “free zone.” Paramount Nagasaki (a conglomerate of movie & pharmaceutical companies) has released another in a series of sci fi movies starring Robin’s computerized likeness as an action hero. 

Flashback – Robin, unhappy after signing the contract, gets arrested by the Paramount police while singing in a nightclub. 

Robin attends a conference in Alhambra, hosted by Paramount Nagasaki; she is the keynote speaker in a meeting that the execs are using to announce their chemical dominance of the world; they are creating a type of chemical manipulation of the senses. Robin gives a controversial and upsetting speech: “If I’m the symbol of the revolution, then the revolution is dead. The world is dead.”

ROBIN meets a designer named DYLAN who admits he is the creator of the sci-fi movie series; through years of manipulating her character he has fallen in love with her.  A rebel force of soldiers start a revolution, fighting against the corporations and against chemical dependency. ROBIN and DYLAN hide in a hotel basement during the uprising. She hallucinates vividly (about JEFF chasing her, about cockroaches in her lap, etc) as bombs and gunfire explode around her. 

JEFF  (as a hallucination) appears and tells her that she has sentenced herself to death by speaking out against the corporation. He shoots her in the head. “this is no hallucination!” 

Doctors in a white OR examine Robin; she has been suffering from a mental illness that has convinced her she was hallucinating when she was not.  They deem her incapable of recovery and freeze her in liquid nitrogen. She dreams while frozen, finding herself in a frozen icescape with her son Aaron. 

2050

Robin wakes up in a thawing facility. She urgently requests to find Aaron and the staff tenderly assures her they are trying their best. Dylan arrives = he has waited for her for 20 years. He tells her they have lost all trace of Aaron. He takes her out into the “real world,” to NYC circa 2050. 

A chemical advancement has replaced technology and “Everyone is what they 
are, everyone is what they want to be, what they always wanted to be.” The drug companies run the world and have created drugs that allow people to entirely alter the chemistry of their brain; rather than watching movies they LIVE the movies. Rather than admire Robin the movie star, they can BECOME Robin. 

Dylan tells her about this new world where chemicals allow anyone to be anything; there is no more war, no more worry… the two have a whirlwind romance and she is blown away by sex in a world where you can pretend your lover is anything you want; not just pretend it, but enjoy the exact physical sensation via chemical stimulation… but Robin is not satisfied. She wants to find Aaron. Dylan admits that he may be on the other side/ on the side of the world not run by chemicals. The only ones there are the people who refused to allow chemicals to alter their lives.  Dylan warns her that its dangerous, as well as unlikely she’ll succeed in finding her son. He also admits that he loves  her and makes a romantic plea for her to stay: “It’s your choice, and I’ll give you anything you want. I love you, Robin. I always have. I loved you for twenty years when I didn’t know you and you were my whole world. 
And I loved you for twenty years when I waited every hour of every day for you to come back.”

Robin takes a pill and leaves the chemical world for the “real” world. It is like a barren wasteland. She finds Aaron’s old doctor who tells her that Aaron waited and waited for Robin for nineteen years, but finally gave up and headed to the chemical land six months ago. There is practically no hope she’ll find him. 

Robin gets put back into the chemical world and begins a desperate hunt for her son.

TITLE: Dali
DIRECTOR: Simon West 
WRITER: Jeremy Walters
CAST: Antonio Banderas
STATUS: In Development
GENRE: Biopic
READER: Steven Murphy

LOGLINE

Story of Salvador Dali, the great iconic painter of the 20th century, by interweaving his love affair with his wife Gala, his friendships and his artistic vision .

COMMENTS

A very straightforward take on the artist’s life, following his rapid rise to fame and fortune in the art world, followed by the requisite precipitous fall after his succumbing to greed and excess.  It will be a juicy role for Antonio Banderas, and that’s certainly the most interesting aspect of this project.  The script itself isn’t particularly moving and often the dialog seems superficial and doesn’t really plumb the depths of Dali’s character in the way one might hope.  During the market, the director will be showing some artwork meant to clarify his take on the visuals of the film which don’t read well on the page, but seem to aim to bring the audience into the actual mind of the artist.  Very broad, popcorn type biopic of the Spanish painter to be directed by the director of CON AIR and LARA CROFT? Iffy. 


SUMMARY

DALI, an old, seemingly crazy man, regales an innocent nurse with the tales of his life.

As a child, Dali was haunted by the knowledge that his older brother, also named Salvador, had died… Salvador Dali had seen his “own” grave as a young child. Even as a child he was blessed with a unique vision, and his father was upset that Dali seemed headed for the penniless life of an artist.  “Don’t come back a failure.” Dali wows his way into art school with inimitable talent (impressing the entrance board by sketching a shockingly beautiful recreation of Michelangelo’s David upside down.) At school Dali befriends many up and coming artists including Federico Garcia Lorca and Luis Bunuel, with whom he collaborated on the work that broke him into the international spotlight, the bizarre, surrealist film UN CHIEN ANDALOU.  Dali quickly becomes the star of the scene, much to the consternation of the movement’s senior guard, but Dali’s arrogance knew no bounds… he went so far as to literally kick surrealist veteran BRETTON in the ass.  Dali finally meets his match in the form of the beautiful (though married) GALA, and the two quickly spark a life long love affair, that would nearly drive them both mad. As his reputation grows, (notably after his famous painting The Persistence of Memory) his relationship gets more and more strained… Gala’s fading beauty sparks a relentless urge for more and more wealth and she relentlessly drives Dali to paint.  Her greed and his arrogance lead to him branding himself, and he winds up getting ripped off by a former chauffeur turned art dealer who hordes the profits (as well as sleeping with Gala).  When Gala dies, the dealer refuses to tell Dali for fear it would cut down on the artist’s production and he virtually keeps Dali a prisoner, but the painter’s spirit cannot be stifled, and his story inspires the innocent young nurse even at the very moments that he drifts away into death.

COMMENTS

Well written and romantic,  I am a big fan of THIS SPORTING LIFE and SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY MORNING, and I like that the creators have mixed that genre of new wave realist British filmmaking with Vampire films, but I’m reluctant to recommend this as a prebuy, definitely not without cast.  The story unravels a bit slowly, but the clever allusions to vampire mythology are handled well, (the scene where COOPER sucks LUCY’s blood through her tampon is almost romantic…) but this is definitely a wait and see.  


SUMMARY


helloDARKNESS is the story of an ordinary man of limited means who became a 
working-class vampire.  His name is Mark Cooper, a Geordie lad, rough-hewn and proud of it.  He hit his prime in the early sixties and as a result of his conversion...never left it.  Eternally young, he is the Angry Young Man preserved in amber.   
 
But perpetual youth has drawbacks.  Like his peers who are now drawing a pension, Cooper has little patience for modern times and new technologies. His personal style -- the shirts and ties of yesteryear, the pomaded quiff -- attests to this. He longs for the past -- when there were three channels on the TV and beer was 10 pence a jar.  He lives in Newcastle, a hardy Northern town with the dark deep river Tyne running along its Southern edge. The city’s famed raucous night-life is concentrated on the quayside, a labyrinth of ancient stairs and passageways leading to pubs that have served pints for centuries. Newcastle provides ideal feeding grounds for this Saturday-night vampire.   
 
On an ordinary weekend, alcohol provides the anesthetic for Cooper’s victims, who get so legless that he can perform his nefarious transfusion undetected.  The next morning they wake with a killer hangover and no memory of the previous night. But then an unfortunate encounter with an anorexic charva girl ends with a corpse floating out to sea and a manhunt underway for the “Tyneside Vampire Killer.” 

Cooper retreats to his council house, where he lives with Rachel, a steely Northern woman with all her wits about her.  She’s been his mainstay and support for almost 
four decades, in an uneasy role somewhere between wife and mother.  Long ago Cooper proposed to convert Rachel, but she turned him down, choosing to grow older while he remains eternally twenty-five.  News that he’s a wanted man brings the tension in the house to snapping point. 

Cooper escapes back to his increasingly dangerous hunting ground, where he meets a beautiful student, Lucy D’Assay-Robinson.  Entranced by her vivacity, Cooper takes the risk of returning to Lucy’s flat, where he gets his overpowering first taste of blue blood. 
 
The union between Cooper and Lucy brews trouble; it brings out the staunch territorialism of Rachel and the virulent snobbishness of Lucy’s set.  Meanwhile, the 
search for the Vampire Killer is intensifying.  Cooper is driven head-first into an existential crisis as he stares bleakly into eternity, and Lucy is forced to choose between the light moneyed world of her peers and the dark working class reality of her lover.

A young German girl leads her siblings through the German countryside during the end of WWII.

COMMENTS:

(Mirjam's Comments): very powerful. A perspective we have never seen before. The writing is very strong. I was absorbed throughout the script. It is heartbreaking, but very interesting to see children from Nazi parents, and what they go through when they realize what their parents were part off. The journey the kids take is paced perfectly. Tension, suspense and emotion all in the right place. 

I recommend the project strongly. Not so much for Lat Am, Indonesia, Middle East, but the rest should read it. 

(Steve's Comments): Brutal brutal story in which the horrors of World War 2 are filtered through the naïve eyes of a young German girl (whose father is a Nazi soldier) forced to brave the torn German country side, shielding her younger siblings from the base side of human nature which she herself is forced to deal with, helping her young brothers and sisters fend off starvation and survive in the face of several threats. The story drags on the page a little,  but there are numerous powerful scenes, but the desperation really made this feel like it’d be a tough one to watch.   The story is powerfully written, but my main concern is that it’s possibly too intense for audiences. 

NOTE: Laure likes the script and says director is quite good.

SUMMARY
In a small village house, young LORE, 14, is elated but confused by the arrival of her VATI (father), an SS officer.  Lore’s MUTTI insists that Lore rouse her younger siblings, LIESEL, 12, her sister, and the male twins GUNTER and JURGEN, 7 and the baby PETER.  Mutti orders the family to begin packing up the house.  VATI and the family pile into a truck with some other SS soldiers, taking them to a small farmhouse, “a safe place til it is over.” 

The FARMER and his WIFE that own the home are not happy to have  MUTTI and the children there.  After one of the children notices bits of ash from a nearby fire that bear the likeness of The FUHRER, Mutti asks Lore to package up all their belongings that have Nazi imagery. Lore is shocked to find MUTTI burning everything.

“Our Fuhrer, Lore.  He’s dead.” Mutti is forced to leave her children, telling Lore only that she has to visit their father and instructing Lore to lead the children to their grandmother’s house if she doesn’t return in three days. 

Lore’s siblings are all upset to hear that their mother has left without saying goodbye, but Lore tries to persuade them that everything is alright.  The children only have slight amounts of food left for them by the farmers.  Lore is forced to punish Gunter for stealing food. 

Lore tells the children they must cross the country and go to their grandmother’s house. Their plan is thrown off course immediately when a train station master tells them that “the Americans took the trains.” Lore realizes they all have to walk. Gunter gets upset, Leisel is openly rebellious, but Lore commands they brave on. 

Badly starved, Lore breaks into what she believes to be an abandoned greenhouse, but finds a dead man covered in ants.  Lore, terrified, demands her siblings leave “GET OUTSIDE!” 

Lore sees photos of some SS soldiers at concentration camps, smoking and looking genial in front of a pile of emaciated corpses.

Lore and the children take shelter in a school house, but the place is miserable and they all wind up with lice. They meet a starving man named THOMAS, whom the younger children fall for immediately, but LORE is wary of his presence. THOMAS helps LORE and the others pass through a checkpoint by claiming to be their brother and producing papers. The Americans drive them over a checkpoint.

Despite his help, LORE resents him because she realizes he’s a jew. She thinks that THOMAS is only staying with them so he can use to the children to beg for food.  The longer he stays, though, her harsh feelings start to ease a bit and she reluctantly begins to warm to him.

Thomas tells them they must make it over a checkpoint by sneaking through the woods.  While he is away searching for food, GUNTER calls out to a man on the horizon who turns out to be a pair of RUSSIAN SOLDIERS, who kill GUNTER. The rest of the children hide in terror. LORE blames THOMAS. “It’s your fault he’s dead and now you want to leave us.”  Thomas insists that there are no more borders before their grandmother’s house.  Thomas leaves them at a train station, but changes his mind and follows them aboard.  On the train LORE is shocked to hear discussion about the prison camps, the concentration camps, the SS soldiers and their murderous ways.  Thomas tells LORE that the stories are true. Lore fears that her father will be hanged.  After they get off the train THOMAS leaves them after he realizes that he’s lost his wallet and his papers. 

LORE and the children make it to OMA’s house.  OMA and her housemaid are elated to see the family, but LORE, scarred by the journey, has a hard time relating and behaving.

A Monk reputed to be the most holy and inspirational in Spain, is beset by temptations and an encroachment of the Devil.

COMMENTS 
I’m not familiar with the work of the director, but this is a very solid; smart arthouse picture with extreme religious overtones that could be an awards type role for Cassell. Commercially, it’s for a niche audience, small, smart, older; and its both well written and highly shocking. There’s a cameo appearance from the DEVIL at the end, but it plays well and doesn’t seem contrived or silly; there are a couple big twists in the story (Valerio = Matilda / Matilda’s in leage with the devil / the devil = the sinner from the outset / Ambrosio = Elvira’s son) and all of them are surprising and chilling.   Probably better suited as something to watch; but its definitely an interesting, smart, chilling script with a great lead role. 

SUMMARY 
A MONK, AMBROSIO, listens to a confession from a SINNER who confesses to sleeping with his underage niece.  The Monk Ambrosio tells him, “Satan only has the power we are willing to give him.” 

FB - On a stormy night, a man places a bundle outside a monastery. “In December 1595, on the night of Saint Ambrose, a baby boy was found before the door of the Capuchin monastery just outside Madrid.”

The baby; AMBROSIO grows up with a love of the scripture and on his eighteenth birthday, joins the order.  Some fellow monks are fearful of him, believing that he is exempt from human failure. 

The grown AMBROSIO inspires his congregation with inspired sermons; beautiful, young ANTONIA is nearly knocked out by his words. Local nobleman LORENZO quickly steps in to lend a hand, and flirt with her. 

Ambrosio takes on a new novice Monk, the disfigured and impoverished VALERIO; a young boy who must wear a mask at all times. In doing so, Ambrosio alienates IAGO; a rival Monk. 

The Brother Superior, MIGUEL, is dying and power is shifting with the monastery. 

Ambrosio is plagued by headaches, and Valerio helps him; he has the power of relieving pain by “laying hands.” Meanwhile, AMBROSIO catches a nun, AGNES, who has betrayed the order and gotten pregnant by a monk, CRISTOBAL. Agnes is banished to the convent’s dungeon. 

Brother Miguel dies, but not before issuing Ambrosio a chilling warning; “I’ve seen him, he’s here… beware!” 

Ambrosio finds Valerio in the rose garden, which is normally meant to be Ambrosio’s private sanctuary.  Valerio confesses that he is actually MATILDA, a woman, and she has joined the monastery because she loves Ambrosio. He banishes her from the monastery; she tries to kill herself but he stops her. She begs for a rose as a remembrance and while reluctantly picking it, he gets bitten by a poisonous centipede.  The other brother’s fear he may die.  Matilda puts back on her mask and resumes acting like VALERIO. 

That night; Matilda sneaks into his room and disrobes; she sucks the poison from his hand, then sits astride Ambrosio; his passion takes hold and he cannot stop himself. They have passionate sex; Matilda is overcome with sickness from the poison, but Ambrosio is cured. He tells her he does not wish to die; she leads him to a cemetery where she walks into an underground passage and then returns, revived. Meanwhile, AGNES dies; and her spirit returns to haunt Ambrosio; accusing him of killing her. 

Ambrosio lets his passion take over and spends some nights with Matilda; IAGO catches him and threatens to tell the other monks; but that night, a gargoyle falls off the roof and kills him.  

Ambrosio snaps at Matlilda; shunning her.  Matilda retreats to her room where she talks to a mysterious VOICE who bids her continue with her mission. 

The nobleman LORENZO has asked for ANTONIA’s hand in marriage; her mother ELVIRA is reticent, because of her own woeful marriage to a nobleman… but Lorenzo is persistent; and after Antonia bids Ambrosio to help Elvira come to peace before dying, Elvira seems to come around and support the marriage.  “I can sense that a shadow has been lifted from her.” Antonia, though, is shocked when she sees a fierce, inappropriate gaze in Ambrosio’s eyes and she sends him away. 

Matilda can see his troubled visage and realizes he is in love with Antonia. She bids him to join her at the cemetery where she can conjure a spirit to help him attain Antonia. Antonia meanwhile, throws herself into Lorenzo’s arms and asks him to promise they will be happy together forever. The nobleman is overjoyed. 

Matilda gives Ambosia a sprig she declares has mystical powers, and indeed, he uses it to open the doors to Antonia’s home, walk inside into her bedroom and easily seduce her. In the morning, her mother Elvira wakes; seeing a vision of the devil over her bed she summons all her strength, grabs a sharp pair of scissors and heads to Antonia’s room, where she is appalled to see Ambrosio lying naked, wrapped around Antonia. “You are the devil.” He kllls her to stop her scream, but not before realizing she is his long lost mother… “mateo!” hence Antonia is his sister. 

Ambrosio is sentenced to burn at the stake, but Matilda takes him to meet THE DEVIL, who appears in the shape of the SINNER from the outset. The Devil offers Ambrosio an eternity of paradise, but Ambrosio makes a deal to ensure Antonia’s lifelong happiness in return for  Ambrosio’s burning in hell.

A struggling young writer finds the seemingly abandoned stories of a little girl and publishes them as her own… after they become best sellers, she is approached and confronted by the father of the missing girl and quickly thrown into a terrifying chase to find the missing girl. 

COMMENTS
They are discussing big names for the female lead, so it could primarily be good for Middle East, because of cast and genre; for others, the script got a bit confusing at the end and I’d say it’s a wait and see.  The thriller aspects worked in parts, but the writer angle and the fact that the plot veered into implausibility make it a bit risky.  Vid value.

An FBI crime drama, about a hard living Irish Guard who is forced to team up with a black FBI agent to break a drug smuggling ring off the west coast of Ireland.

COMMENTS
Script reminds me, not coincidentally, of IN BRUGES with Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson, which was written and directed by McDonagh’s more famous brother MARTIN MCDONAGH… and that film crackled on the page, but was directed a bit less well and was a bit of a disappointment overall. These types of films are some of my personal favorites (despite the fact that they largely struggle to find big audiences), and this script was completely satisfying… Gleeson’s character is the hard boiled loner with a heart of gold, in the grand tradition of Philip Marlowe, with a ton of Irish deadpan wit and cynicism and boozy charm. Cheadle’s part is a bit thin; he’s little more than a foil to Gleeson. The script is tidy and plot is clever and the payoff brought a smile to my face. Still, its small and this type of thing might be tough outside English speaking territories,
especially as much of the witticisms are unique to Ireland, but all that being said, I like it.

SUMMARY
Grizzled veteran cop BOYLE steals drugs from a car crash victim, eating LSD and staring off into the sunrise: “it’s a beautiful day.”

BOYLE is assigned a new partner, a young cop from Dublin, MCBRIDE, and the two are sent to investigate a strange homicide. BOYLE mocks MCBRIDE’s tactics and naïve suspicions; “a serial killer? The idiocy I have to deal with.” BOYLE visits his mother who is dying of cancer. She has six weeks to live. “It’s not what’s on the outside that counts, its what’s on the inside, eating you up.” BOYLE gets a call from an anonymous tipster, “Bozo… the fucking… clown…” who tells him that the murder was done by “Billy Devaney.” Boyle and Mcbride bring him in, but find out that he’s got an alibi; he was in a bar fight the night of the murders. He’s
clearly been framed.

An American FBI agent arrives and briefs the GALWAY PD about a shipment of half a billion dollars of cocaine that is arriving on the shores of Ireland. After rudely mocking the agent EVERETT a bit, BOYLE surprises everyone when he announces that one of the drug dealer suspects is in fact dead. “Let’s put it this way, I hope he’s dead, ‘cause they’ve put him the fucking morgue, anyways.”

McBride pulls over the drug traffickers, OLEARY, SHEEHY and CORNELL. They shoot and kill McBride. “He took it rather well… was very philosophical about it.” GABRIELLE MCBRIDE gets worried when her husband fails to come home, and she arrives on BOYLE’s doorstep, asking him for help. BOYLE assures her that there’s
likely nothing wrong. “He’s probably out on a tear… the lash…”

BOYLE spends his day off in a hotel with a pair of hookers while EVERETT canvases the people of Galway, hoping for a lead. He gets absolutely nowhere. “Fuck off, yank.” BOYLE finds MCBRIDE’s Guarda squad car parked by a local suicide spot. GABRIELLA tells BOYLE that MCBRIDE was gay. Boyle suspects foul play.
BOYLE checks video footage of DEVANEY’s bar fight, and EVERETT is shocked to see SHEEHY and CORNELL on the video; “they’re here!”

CORNELL gives a Galway cop MOODY a payoff to stay out of their business. “Somebody got out of bed on the wrong side this morning.”

SHEEHY tries to pay off BOYLE, and threatens him to stay out of it. “You can’t just arrest me. There are men behind the men.” SHEEHY and the other smugglers are impressed that BOYLE didn’t take the money. “Still, we can’t have that… we’ll have to make sure he’s out of harm’s way.

OLEARY breaks into BOYLE’s in the middle of night and holds him at gunpoint. “Your future is so short it wouldn’t stand knee high to a midget.” BOYLE gets the jump on him and shoots him in the chest, killing him. “If there’s one thing I hate its self pity.” BOYLE phones EVERETT and tells him that the shipment is coming in. He drives to Gabriellas and tells her that MCBRIDE is dead. “I’ve finished off one of the lads that did it. I’m just going down now to sort out the others.”

EVERETT, against his better judgment, returns and helps BOYLE face off against SHEEHY, CORNELL and their henchman who are unloading 200 million in cocaine. BOYLE kills CORNELL as Everett covers him with machine gun fire. SHEEHY escapes onto the yacht and makes a break for it, but BOYLE jumps on the yacht and kills Sheehy. The yacht goes up in flames and sinks.

EVERETT thinks that Boyle has died, thinking that no one could swim back from that… “Aye, you’d have to be a really good swimmer.” Everett recalls that Boyle was an Olympic swimmer and realizes that Boyle has made a break of it, planning to escape to America to avoid being killed as retribution by the drug runners. “I can’t decide if you’re really fucking stupid, or really fucking smart.”

COMMENTS
The best script I’ve read precannes so far; easily.  It’s a dense, amazing world filled with politically motivated action, great characters and deep, moving material from start to finish.  The cast is superb; I’m excited to see Whitaker and Winstone specifically, each man is haunted by his past, living in a desperate situation, and in a very grim way, able to find some hope and humanity… even the gangsters are imbued with humanity and spirit.  My only concern is that I don’t know if the director has the chops to turn this great script into something special on screen.  Might be worth a risk, merely because the script is so damn good.

SUMMARY
Two taxi drivers are battling for fares when the older driver, MANDELISI, shoots the younger driver in the face.

Highly decorated officer JOSEPH MAHOLA, a black former freedom fighter, is being honored for valor by government minister MABOTE when he is called away to investigate the taxi murder.  Strangely, RONNIE, a former pro apartheid detective from the SCORPIONS ( a group of white cops who tracked and tortured black freedom fighters) is also put on the case and the two make an unlikely team.  “Welcome to the taxi wars.”

The local taxi business is corrupt and dangerous; the driver who was killed was actually a wealthy business owner test driving one of his newer cars;  “one of the original taxi millionaires.”  MANELISI, the killer, has been hired by a criminal boss, BLACKJACK.  Blackjack visits MANELISI in a run down hostel to hire him for another hit; MANELISI stores his pay in the mouth of a dead man that is decaying in his room.

MABOTE tells JOSEPH and RONNIE that they are now a two man task force assigned to stop the taxi wars in time for the World Cup.

MANELISI kills another taxi boss, and the cops mistakenly believe it is retaliation for the first killing.  They get a tip about the killer’s license plate and are shocked when MANELISI pulls in right in front of them; they start a chase, opening fire on MANELISI and his car full of hitmen.  MANELISI calls BLACKJACK begging for help.  BLACKJACK sets up his sniper rifle in the street and KILLS Manelisi and the Hit Men; eliminating his link to the crime.  The Cops crash and are lucky to be alive; they realize that they were being fired at by a professional soldier. “That wasn’t taxi shit, that was sniper shit.”

A white business man, STEFAN, approaches BLACKJACK and hires him to get back into the killing business. Blackjack is violently reluctant at first, but eventually acquiesces.  They want Blackjack to dress like a taxi driver so the hits look like part of the taxi wars.

Blackjack goes undercover at the local cab depot; he sees the son of a café owner LUNGA, hanging out, trying to get work. NELSON is desperate; his father is dying of AIDS, but no one helps him.  NELSON reluctantly teams up with low rent gangster VIRUS, “a deal with the devil.”

BLACKJACK gets a text telling him that his first target is “Chairman Njomane.”  Blackjack kills him with a car bomb; and gets another text; “GOOD WORK.”

Nelson gets a job working for a sketchy criminal, VIRUS, as a drop off, pickup boy.

Blackjack meets with Stefan to get paid for the job, but the transaction is interrupted by another text from his client, telling him to kill Stefan. Blackjack shoots him; “nothing personal.” Blackjack tells the mysterious client that he’s done, but CLIENT insists their relationship is “ongoing.”  Blackjack hangs up and stops answering his phone.

RONNIE, in search of the identity of the sniper who attacked them; heads to an old comrade of his; one of the Scorpions from Apartheid. GERT, an old, mean vet, tells him all the soldiers are away working as mercenaries.
 Ronnie is hurt that Gert wont put their newly opposing politics aside. 
Gert tells Ronnie not to come to Piet’s bachelor party. (PIET is Gert’s son, Ronnie’s God Son).

JOSEPH has a similar situation with his old comrade in the MK (freedom
fighters) who feels betrayed by the fact that the new government has not delivered on their promises to create jobs for the fighters.

Blackjack visits Serena at the strip club; but when he comes out he finds his Porsche has been stolen and replaced by a toy car. He gets a text from the client: “Answer your phone next time.”  He finds out that the client has also burned down his mother’s house.

Blackjack goes to Stefan’s house and talks to his widow; “I killed him.”
He finds Stefan’s safe; gets some info and money and tells her to leave for America. “Should I thank you?”

Joseph believes the killer is former MK and they follow some leads that take them to Blackjack’s mother’s home.

A Nigerian kills VIRUS and nearly kills NELSON; but luckily for him, Blackjack is nearby and comes to his rescue, killing the criminal.
Blackjack yells at the boy and tells him to become a man.

LUNGA tips off RONNIE and JOSEPH about Blackjack, just as Blackjack is returning to the café to drop off the traumatized Nelson. The cops don’t realize Blackjack is the man they’re after, as he’s no longer driving the car they’re after (the Porsche).

Blackjack sees them heading towards his house and tries to kill them with a bomb; they are dazed but alright.  Blackjack is on the run with nowhere to turn. He hides in Mandelisi’s old hostel; breaking open the dead man’s mouth to retrieve Mandelisi’s hidden riches.

Blackjack brings SERENA to the white enclave to pretend to be surprise strippers for PIET’s bachelor party.  The girls tie up GERT and PIET; Blackjack comes in and holds them hostage; shooting Gert in the leg. 
Blackjack has gotten gert’s info from the safe and knows Gert helped the CLIENT hire him… “why did they pick me?” Gert was one of the South African cops who tortured “kaffir” soldiers.  “He needed an outcast.”  Blackjack gets the info he needs and stops short of killing them. Serena tells him never to come back, “I cant live with all this rage.”

The transportation minister, ERIC MABOTE is arranging a ceremony in a main street; Blackjack gets a text to head there for a job; but rather look for his targets (JOSEPH & RONNIE) he heads towards his CLIENT; MOSES.  Joseph realizes what’s going down and tries to stop Blackjack, afraid he is going to spark an all out massacre.  MOSES’ bodyguards and Joseph shoot him down

RONNIE arrests GERT for conspiracy for his involvement in the taxi wars, but Gert kills himself.  Joseph tells Ronnie he’s afraid he’ll always be plagued by the question of what Blackjack was really doing when he got shot down; but NELSON brings the evidence to the police that reveals the final secret: MABOTE was behind the hits.  Ronnie and Joseph arrest the corrupt leader.

COMMENTS 
British Film Noir film is a genre I enjoy, but is generally quite tough commercially.  The script revolves around a classic femme fatale type, to be played by Rampling, and her character is given a lot of room to show off Rampling’s grace and gravitas – she’s an aging divorcee, desperate and absent minded who turns out to be harboring a traumatic past that she has done everything she can to forget.  Byrne’s role is also archetypal; he’s an aging detective who’s been hurt and is slow to open up to love, only to have it destroy him when he finally does.  There are poignant scenes, but the plot is overly predictable for the most part.  There is a twist at the end (ANNA has been hallucinating that she’s been interacting with her daughter, who, in fact, left her years ago) which leads to perhaps the most heart wrenching scene in the film, but doesn’t do enough to make this unique or captivating.  Not a prebuy.  

SUMMARY
MORRIS’s flat has a leak in the roof; and when he walks upstairs to find the source of the excess water, he finds a dead body in the apartment above. Morris turns the tap off.  Police inspector BERNIE arrives on the scene.   ANNA, a mysterious woman, appears in the building’s lobby and Bernie holds the elevator door open for her. BERNIE is smitten, despite the fact that the two hardly interact.   

STEVIE, a tough looking 16 year old, makes several desperate phone calls before rushing to his mother’s house, where he catches her sleeping with a younger man.  STEVIE tells her that he “warned” his father…  JANET is terrified and can sense that something has gone wrong. “What did you do?”  Janet calls her ex, GEORGE, but a policeman picks up. “I’m afraid there has been an incident.” Janet quickly hangs up. 
Police come to Janet’s home and question her; asking about when she last talked to George, and why she called his apartment the previous day.  

Flashback. ANNA goes to a singles mixer.  She meets GEORGE STONE.  

BERNIE uses his access on the force to track ANNA via her license plate number. He goes to her apartment and secretly watches her.    

ANNA’s daughter EMMY, who, along with her toddler CHIARA, lives with ANNA (“three generations of single women in the same house”), convinces Anna to go to another mixer.  BERNIE follows her there and strikes up a conversation with her.  The two get along well.  She gives BERNIE her number and eagerly waits for his call.  He thinks about calling her, but repeatedly fails to gather up the nerve.  

Flashback – ANNA goes back to George’s apartment.  STEVIE comes in.  The two get into an argument.  
COPS in Blackpool pull over JANET and STEVIE and bring them into the station, where they question them about GEORGE’s death.  “We are the police, ma’am. You better not lie to us.”  

BERNIE questions STEVIE and gets enraged about the way the boy talks about his own, dead, father.  “You’ll understand when you have kids.”  They arrest STEVIE for murder.

Comments:
(MW) I say it's Motorcycle Diaries meets Into The Wild meets Tideland meets Howl. But Tideland and Howl dominate, and I didn't feel those films where strong enough. The script has many good intentions, and succeeds on some levels.   Their prices are a bit high for this genre. It is meant for young wanderers, wanting to travel, to explore, to do drugs, to have no care, no money. So it is really geared to an young audience, High schoolers, College students. The reason why I don't think it holds, is that the film is too episodic, choppy. There is no flow. Connections between characters and events are lost, which makes us not invested enough in the characters and what they are going through. I never feel the Dean attraction. With Walter Salles at the helm, it is very very likely he will be able to put that on the screen, but it's not on the page.  For the right price it is still one to strongly consider and read for yourself. Walter Salles combined with this cast does promise a film to look forward to. 

Marc Smit’s Comments: It is a very difficult book to turn into a film. As it is more about a rhythm and an era than a story.  The script breaks a little bit the continuous flow of the book by being a bit more event-led. This was the only way to do it but slightly takes us away from the essence of the book. The events give more of a narrative development and something to chew on for the viewer.  The script could be stronger: Would have expected a bit more initimacy between the characters, a bit more empathy. But dialogues are good and again it is all down to how he makes the movie (even more true for this project). Still feel the script could do with one or two stronger scenes.  The success of this project resides more on the execution than the script. Salles has to make it more than a string of scenes, and avoid the teenage drifter type film (kind of hippie bullshit, “WOODSTOCK before it happens” kind of stuff). Because luckily the book is set in the late 50s and not in the 70s when being a hippie was already more of a mainstream behavior.  The story has not a lot of dramatic evolution, a lot of ellipses. Apart from the fact that the lead, Dean, does not evolve (bleak conclusion to period) and Sal, more reasonable, is now a more of a respectable character. Before that: a spiral going slightly downwards (but still having been worth living). It is more a constant stream of encounters and a lot of sex (although nice can be tedious if not well done or too repetitive). Salles will need to create a lot of empathy with the characters which he can do. GOOD actors involved so may work.  Question about the audience. Most people I know, know about this book (not all have read it). Relevance to younger audiences? Yes, I think so (like “Into the wild”). Further young and popular actors. Relevance to older audiences? Yes, but will film be faithful to book ?  At at the crossraod between Motorcycles DIaries, Stranger than paradise, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, Into the wild – with a bit of kinky stuff and teenage angst.
 
Synopsis:
The narrator, Sal Paradise, is on an epic quest, one that takes him back and forth across the United States with Dean Moriarity who is  based on the real-life Neal  Cassady.  Dean, the reform school escapee who specializes in stealing cars, is Sal's mentor.  And it is the automobile that is their chariot, which keeps them constantly in motion.  Dean's madness is glorified, as is his ability to do whatever he pleases. There are a lot of drugs, but liquor and pot seems to be their drug of choice.  They leave the heroin for a character loosely based on the real William Burroughs.  Women drift in and out of the story, usually as one of Dean's lovers who he treats terribly. Dean treats everyone terribly though, abandoning Sal on several occasions, once while Sal was suffering from dysentery while they were in Mexico.  Sal, however, always forgives Dean, seeing him as a god-like hero, no matter what he does. 

Dean is a complex character, really always on the search for his homeless father. A restless soul, with so much charisma, he leaves women with children behind all over the country and at any time they are ready to take him back.

Dark.  Violent.  Small.  It’s a gritty little script with a simple but moving idea – a father’s revenge.  It’s well-written in its way, and it definitely moves without any dead space, but without anything that makes it truly memorable.  Artistically solid but commercially risky.  There are few characters, only one subplot that isn’t really developed, and lots of violence.  There isn’t much in THE RETURN that will set it apart from other ex-con dramas, and while Pacino’s acting skills are admirable, he has aged into a wiry little chatterbox and just isn’t the box office powerhouse he once was.  

SYNOPSIS:
Aging convict FRANK RICCETTI is examined by his prison DOCTOR for the last time.  He is prescribed medication but his prognosis, whatever it is, remains unchanged.  Frank accepts this without emotion; he seems a meek and mild gentleman.

Frank is released from the penitentiary after a twenty-two year sentence, and is met outside by his son JOEY.  It’s an emotional reunion for them both.  They ride to their old home in the Detroit area, which now presumably belongs to someone else.  Without telling Joey what he’s doing, Frank breaks into the basement, finds a long hidden key and digs up a chest.  Inside the chest are stacks of cash and a baseball bat still smeared with bloody fingerprints.  Frank transfers everything to a duffle bag, and then checks himself and Joey into a five-star hotel.  He promises Joey a week of luxury living and Joey is delighted.  The only friction comes when Frank infers that Joey is too skinny; Joey takes offense and thinks his father is digging around to see if he is using again.  Frank quickly smooths things over.

Frank – now dapperly dressed and all cleaned up – goes to see an old friend QUENTIN; they both lived a life of crime all those years ago.  Quentin insists that he has been out of that life for twenty years, and commiserates with Frank for the time he spent in prison.  Frank asks for a name, just a name, but Quentin refuses.  Frank was set up to take the fall in a murder case for people he once trusted; he was only supposed to do a few years, and now he’s after revenge.  Finally Quentin gives Frank the number of a man who supplies weapons – but no names.  Back at the hotel, Frank notices a beautiful woman eating dinner with an older man.  It’s hard for him to believe she’s a prostitute.  He notices the woman’s pimp, the sleazy know-nothing  TRIP.
 
Frank goes to the unnamed supplier, who is turns out to be a local gang leader named SLEEPY.  He sells Frank a suppressed Uzi, ammunition, and a classic muscle car.  Later, Quentin has reconsidered; he finds Frank and gives him the name and whereabouts of one of the conspirators against him.  His name is JIMMY and he’s in a retirement home.  Frank finds him but his mind seems nearly completely gone.  Jimmy was Frank’s old partner who ultimately helped set him up, killed a man with a baseball bat, and then let Frank take the fall.  But Jimmy seems to remember none of this.  Frank nonetheless strangles him with a towel.  As he slips unseen from the home, Frank is slowed by a cough that draws blood.  

Finally Frank summons his courage and introduces himself to the beautiful prostitute who works the five-star hotel lounge.  This is SIMONE.  She charges $2500 for the first hour but promises Frank she is worth every penny.  They have passionate sex, and afterward, Frank is forced to gently evade her questions.  She sees his prison tattoos and wonders what he was in for.  He doesn’t answer.  

The next day, Frank’s cough continues.  He also comes across Joey in a terrible part of town and insists he take off his sunglasses.  It’s clear that Joey is high.  Frank is saddened.  He admits to being a shitty father but swears he’ll do better.  He seeks out Simone again, and they go for a drive.  She sees a scar on his neck and applies some Vitamin E to it; Frank is smitten.  When she again asks about his criminal past, he reveals too much, and scares her.  

Frank continues his search for his enemies, and he pays an old buddy court clerk, GEORGE, to secure for him the address of a crooked lawyer, LUCERO.  Frank goes to Lucero’s home and finds the attorney alone, so he thinks.  Lucero offers him money in exchange for his life, but Frank doesn’t want money.  When Lucero’s young Cuban boyfriend RICKY enters and screams, Frank tries to warn him, but ends up shooting him.  Before killing Lucero, Frank gets the info on his final target and the man, MAX, that Frank feels did him the most painful wrong.  A screaming Lucero tells Frank that Max owns a restaurant bearing his name in Ferndale.  Frank drives there and charms the hostess, who reveals that Max will be honored there the next night at a fancy banquet for all the good he has done the community.
  
That evening, Frank schedules another date with Simone, but a different prostitute shows up to his hotel room.  Frank refuses her, and she is indignant, but finally leaves.  Trip the pimp knocks on Frank’s door demanding money (a cancellation fee, plus a ‘touching’ fee, since Frank grabbed her by the arm when she wouldn’t go).  Frank refuses, and Trip threatens violence. Frank has had enough, and pulls the pimp’s head into the doorjamb, nearly crushing it.  He threatens him with his Uzi and sends Trip running.  

Simone avoids Frank’s phone calls, which upsets him.  He rushed her, he didn’t treat her well.  But things seem to be looking up when Joey returns and stays with his father for the night without taking off; Frank watches him sleeping and is glad that his boy is safe.  In the morning, they visit the grave of Frank’s late wife …  and next to her headstone is Joey’s.  He looks at it.  “I was only twenty-five,” he muses.  Joey died in 1995.  Frank has been imagining him.
 
Frank stakes out Simone’s apartment, and when he sees her pushing her baby daughter in a stroller, he approaches with his garbage bag filled with his remaining money.  He gives it to her and thanks her for being kind to him in his last days; she takes it with tears of gratitude.  He then goes to the restaurant and joins the ceremony where Max is being feted, and though his health gets worse by the moment, he clears the room by shooting into the ceiling and confronts Max one on one.  Max, Frank accuses, promised to look after Joey when Frank went to prison.  Max is furious and shouts back at Frank, reminding him that despite what he chooses to remember, his son was a lousy junkie with no future.  Max didn’t trust him to stay silent because of his addiction; they tortured him until they were sure he hadn’t flipped. 

Police sirens wail outside and Max tries to get away, but Frank overtakes him and in the final act of his life, Frank beats Max to death with the very baseball bat he had stored all these years – the bat Max used in the murder that was later pinned on Frank.  Surrounded by the police, Frank says his goodbyes to Joey’s ghost, which vaporizes in the distance, and then dies. 

The final image is Frank’s grave next to his wife’s and Joey’s.

Soon after moving into their seemingly idyllic new home, a family learns of a brutal crime committed against former residents of the dwelling.

COMMENTS 
The script features a lead character suffering from dementia, and the story is set up to mislead the audience for the entire first half of the movie; his “Dream House” was literally a dream, albeit one induced by pharmaceutical narcotics, and as he slowly comes down off the drugs a terrible realization sets in… he killed his entire family. After that initial shocking / confusing revelation, the twists keep coming rapidly, flipping realities back and forth until the audience no longer has any real grip on what’s real and what’s not.  Coupling that with a rushed climactic sequence and the script left me more disoriented than thrilled.  Seems like a forgettable thriller, whose premise leads to a few truly bad scenes.  Popcorn only.  Not a fan. 

SUMMARY 
WILL, an overworked publishing executive, quits his job in order to spend more time with his wife and two young daughters in their beautiful country house, but their idyllic lifestyle is quickly interrupted by the shocking news that the house was previously owned by a family who were all massacred (a women and two daughters) by their own husband, who now lives in a mental institution and claims innocence.   “I knew there was something wrong.  I knew this wasn’t going to last.” 

WILL struggles to get to the bottom of the mystery, but no one can give him any information; the real estate agent who sold him the house has seemingly vanished, his neighbors shy away from him, and some are even overtly threatening.   “You’ve got balls living in that house, he’ll be back.  Satan must be fed.”   Will notices a mysterious man in a parka lurking around the house.   Will goes to the mental hospital to find the killer, PETER WARD, because he believes Ward is the one lurking around and Will is shocked to find out that HE is actually Peter Ward; he has hallucinated everything about his current life.

WILL is destroyed. His wife and daughters are actually dead; his current interaction with them is complete hallucination.  

WILL turns to his neighbor for help.  She insists that she believes he is innocent.  WILL gets attacked by BOYCE, who claims to be a detective trying to prove that WILL/ PETER was behind the original murders, but WILL realizes that BOYCE was actually hired to kill a neighbor, but he botched it.  BOYCE was hired by the neighbor’s husband.  WILL thwarts a second murder attempt and saves his neighbors and exonerates himself in the process. 

He promises to move to a house nearby.

COMMENTS 
A really well written script that I found both interesting and moving at times.  The romance really is more of the focus of the script than the thriller aspect; it is more of a female geared story as the thriller aspect of the ship only comes into play towards the end and really only serves to set up the love story… it plays like a cross between SOLARIS and THE LAKEHOUSE.   Presumably a big budget; though I have no info on it, nor am I sure the director ( I don’t think there’s one attached yet).  Definitely a well written script, but interesting only if Reeves can work as a big name ROMANTIC lead.  NOT an action movie. 

SUMMARY 
An interstellar space ship carries passengers a hundred light years through space to a newly created planet; HOMESTEAD II.  In order to avoid aging during the flight, the passengers and crew are all frozen as the ship flies itself the majority of the trip.  JAMES, a mechanic eager to start a life on a new planet, wakes up early;  he’s the only one awake on board and he realizes that he’s in a lot of trouble – there is no way to freeze himself back to sleep.  He will live his entire life during the flight and die, alone.  

His situation could be worse, he has the run of the ship and takes advantage of the myriad activities, video games, luxury restaurants and free booze served by a friendly android bartender ARTHUR; but JAMES longs for companionship.  For months he struggles with a terrible decision – he has fallen in love with a hibernating woman named AURORA, a writer, and he desperately wants to wake her, but realizes the action is akin to murder.  He asks ARTHUR for advice, and asks the android to keep it secret.

Eventually, after being driven nearly mad by loneliness, JAMES wakes her up.  AURORA is unfriendly at first, and pragmatically demands that they find a way to save their own lives, either by putting themselves back to sleep, turning the ship around, or coming up with some plan, but eventually she reaches the same conclusion that James had: they have no choice but to live their lives entirely on the ship, likely to die before they reach the new planet. 

They make the most of the situation; James shows her the fun activities on the ship and even asks her out on a date.  They eventually fall in love, but their happiness is cut short after ARTHUR lets the secret out; he tells Aurora that James woke her up.  AURORA is beyond mad, she calls JAMES a murdered and refuses to speak to him for a year.  

Meanwhile, strange events take place on the ship; robots malfunction, elevators break, gravity locks falter, and even ARTHUR dies.  GUS, a crew member, wakes up  as a result of a malfunctioning hibernation pod.  GUS tries to help fix the ship, but gets bad news from the medical bay; he is dying – quickly.  GUS kills himself by jumping into space, leaving JAMES to fix the ship. JAMES nearly has to kill himself to open a vent door to keep the ship from exploding.  He saves the day, but falls into space, saved only when AURORA, desperate not to lose him, comes out of the ship and pulls him back in.

Ninety years later the crew arrive at the destination and find that JAMES and AURORA have lived a life and died; having built a little cottage in the middle of the ship.  They are buried in flower beds, next to each other.

LOGLINE

Shelby, Tabitha, and Lisa were childhood friends with a boy with an odd sense of humor, and an even odder love for pain and suffering.  They are about to learn that mistakes don’t just go away…they grow up, they grow evil.  Because when HIS AMUSEMENT is this insatiable, your life is little more then a joke gone too far, and like every joke…it eventually dies.

COMMENTS

There are three different horror installations in this movie, and they all tie together thematically, revolving around a creepy, terrifying laugh, and elaborate murder schemes set up by the three girls’ former friend.  The stories are all creepy on their own, but the intro and climax are the weakest aspect… The script would be more chilling if these girls had all met their horrible fates coincidentally, instead of forcing us to believe this strange revenge concept.  The convoy sequence and the clown sequence are the strongest.  It’s full of scares, but not great.  


SUMMARY
INTRO – Three young girls, Shelby, Tabitha, and Lisa make lovely dioramas in a shoebox and show them off to each other.  A young boy lets the girls see his diorama, and they are shocked to see that it’s a mutilated squirrel.

PRESENT DAY – An older Tabitha is being interviewed by a police officer, “Do you know where Rob Ellerbe is?”

PART 1 - THE CONVOY – ROB ELLERBE drives his car in a convoy.   His girlfriend SHELBY is nervous that he’s going too fast, and begs him to slow down.  To assuage her fears, Rob tells her how a convoy works, and shows her that despite the speed, it’s actually safer than driving alone.  The convoy pulls over to refuel.  The lead vehicle is a truck, driven by a single man.  Behind Rob is a van driven by a father, his wife and kids sleeping soundly while he drives. 

At the gas station, Rob and BERT, the father, chat amicably.  The truck driver, TRYTON, a curt, edgy guy, tells them that there’s a traffic jam ahead and suggests they follow him on a shortcut.  Tryton tells Rob that he’s driving alone, which alarms Shelby, who believes she saw a girl slumped over in the passengers seat.  

As they drive on the dirt path, the truck’s tire blows.  They all pull over while Tryton fixes his tire.  Rob asks about the girl in the front seat, and Tryton angrily denies he’s got a passenger.  Bert and Rob, freaked out, secretly agree to break off the convoy, but as soon as they get back on the road, the truck’s driver side door swings open and a woman flies out, smashing into Rob’s windshield.  The truck drives away quickly.  Bert pulls over and starts administering CPR to the woman.  He tells Rob to chase Tryton’s truck and get it’s license plate.  Rob drives off, but the truck has turned around and speeds back past him.  When Rob gets back to the scene of the accident, Shelby and the other woman are gone.  “He took em,” a badly beaten Bert says.  Rob drives Bert’s van, and the two of them try to find a phone.  They see Tryton’s truck parked at an abandoned shack, where he is talking on the phone.  Bert grabs a crowbar and smashes Tryton in the face.  Rob hears rustling in the backseat and realizing that Bert’s family is dead.  Shelby’s body lies in a pile with them, barely alive.  Bert rushes over to the car and strangles Rob.

PRESENT DAY – Tabitha is getting interviewed by a shrink.  

THE CLOWN – Tabitha goes to her cousin’s house to baby-sit her two young cousins, both boys.  The boys love clowns, and the house is full of rather scary toy clowns.  She is disturbed by the fact that the boy’s babysitter isn’t there when she arrives, but the boys tell her the sitter had to go home.  Tabitha hears strange noises from upstairs, but thinks that the boys are just horsing around.  The babysitter’s mother calls, worried that her daughter hasn’t come home.  

At night, Tabitha struggles to sleep, but is creeped out by a life sized clown doll sitting in the room.  When the aunt calls to check on the boys, Tabitha asks her about the doll,  “we don’t have anything like that.”  The call is cut short because the life sized clown attacks, chasing them with an ax.  The boys climb out their bedroom window and lock themselves in a shack.  Tabitha runs next door to the neighbors, seeing a woman sitting in a hot tub.  She screams to the woman for help, but realizes it’s the babysitter, and she’s dead…

Tabitha runs into the neighbor’s house and realizes that the house is full of Closed circuit tv’s, all monitoring the boy’s house.  The man in a clown suits runs into the house, grabbing Tabitha…

PRESENT DAY – A psychiatrist asks Tabitha how she knew Rob Ellerbe. Tabitha yells, “what happened to Lisa?”

The MATTRESS – 

CAT and LISA go out for a night of drinking and dancing.  When Lisa returns to her room, she is surprised to see that Cat has not come home.  Lisa and her boyfriend DAN, try to call Cat, but realize that Cat has left her phone in the dorm.  Lisa thinks that Cat may be at a seedy hotel with some guy she met.  They call, but can’t get through, so Lisa and Dan head to the hotel.  Dan uses his health inspector badge to force his way into the hotel.  The night manager kills Dan.  Lisa gets sick of waiting, and nervously follows him inside.  She walks into a strange dorm filled with mattresses.  A SIMPLETON sits on one of the beds and the rest of the room is empty.  Lisa hears strange noises from one of the mattresses and cuts it open, finding Cat inside, struggling for her life.  She cuts open another mattress and finds Dan, dead.  To her surprise, the Simpleton attacks her, ties her up, and sews her into a mattress.

PRESENT DAY – 

The psychiatrist tells Tabitha that the last thing all three girls remember is a vicious laugh.  “I was called here tonight after authorities found a body outside, and you three locked in rooms.”  The psychiatrist leads Tabitha into a basement and shows her Lisa and Shelby.

Tabitha realizes that the female shrink is actually BERT from the CONVOY, THE CLOWN attacker and THE SIMPLETON from the mattress – the scary young boy whom these three girls knew in grade school has grown up into a killer.  He wants to get back at the three girls for ratting him out and ruining his life.  The three girls run through the warehouse which is filled with old carnival costumes.  The girls dress in costumes to blend in, but Lisa and Shelby are killed.

Packed with Action.  Deals with themes of betrayal, revenge, honor, friendship, and a desire to protect one’s family. Primary demographic will be males ages 16 and up.

Upside: Packed with three dimensional characters; all with satisfying arcs. The needs of the story are perfectly balanced with the action sequences and comedic relief. Downside: There is a lack of explanation as to the nature of the Russians involvement and more specifically what it that Lynch has been programmed with.

SUMMARY
ACT I - A 16 year old girl, Eliza Kane has been kidnapped. She is forced to make a ransom tape. She’s frightened but hides it well. She refuses to show any sign of weakness. She tells her faceless captor that he’s wasting his time. Eliza hates her father, and her father doesn’t care about her.

In Caracas Venezuela, Sean Merrick and Marcus Kane have taken up position on the roof top of a hotel that’s under construction. It is clear that they are old friends and brothers in arms. Kane is in command of a dozen mercenaries that have taken up position. Their handler had hired them to take out an arms dealer.

A motorcade carrying a dozen agents including CIA agent Carmikael and their captive Ray Heathrow pulls into the street. Kane is shocked to see the diplomatic plates on the vehicles; this is not what he signed up for. He has his men hold their position. Suddenly the caravan is hit by a rocket; gunfire erupts below. A shadow group of Mercenaries is attacking the convoy. Kane orders his men on the ground to take engage them. Chaos ensues as the convoy is destroyed and Kane’s men, along with the other agents, are killed. The shadow group hustles Heathrow into a waiting car, it’s been a rescue mission. 

The rooftop is rocked by an explosion. The rest of Kane’s men lay in pieces all around him. Kane searches the rubble for Merrick, who is waiting for him gun drawn. Merrick was in on the double cross, he’s about to shoot Kane when a teammate shoots Merrick in the back. Merrick kills the mercenary and turns back to Kane who has used the distraction to pull his gun. They exchange fire and Merrick escapes out the window; Kane follows.

Carmikael pulls himself from the wreckage. He’s the only surviving Agent. He spots Kane coming down the scaffolding on the side of the hotel and alerts the MP’s who have begun arriving. 

Kane chases after Merrick who dives into a waiting Land Rover. Kane hijacks a double decker bus and chases him through the streets of Caracas. They exchange fire, until the Land Rover takes cover behind the bus. Kane breaks out the back window and is about to fire when the SUV rams the bus, sending Kane flying through the windshield of the SUV. Kane empties his gun into the three other mercenaries and then has a knife fight with Merrick. Merrick slices Kane’s face and dives out of the moving vehicle. The SUV crashes and Kane is picked up by the MPs. Kane is convicted of treason against the United States of America and sentenced to death. 

James Lynch is a schizophrenic tow truck operator living in Los Angeles. One day while towing a BMW he had as psychotic episode which causes him to get into an accident. He loses his job. Later Lynch spends the night making love to his wife Tracy. He wakes up in the morning to find her dead, and his place covered in blood. One of his personalities, the ‘Evil Lynch,’ appears in the mirror and demands to be let out. Lynch covers his ears and tries to make the voices go away. Lynch turns himself in, is convicted, and sentenced to death.

Carmikael meets with Kane before he boards the prison bus and offers him a pardon in exchange for his cooperation in helping them track down the people who hired him. Kane turns him down. He boards the bus and is seated next to Lynch who is lost in a psychotic episode, muttering and banging his head against the window. In route to the prison the bus is hit by a truck. Mercenaries attack, killing everyone in the bus, while abducting Kane and Lynch.

As Kane and Lynch are held in a van on a ferry crossing the bay in San Francisco, Merrick shows Kane the video we saw in the opening. Heathrow has gone missing and unless Kane can track him down, Merrick is going to kill Kane’s family. Merrick takes a call from his handlers and it quickly becomes clear that Lynch is of some great value to them. When Merrick steps out of the van to continue his call, Kane kills three guards and escapes with Lynch. 

ACT II - Kane and Lynch are fleeing in a stolen church van, while Kane grills Lynch about why Merrick's people want him. Lynch has another episode and the ‘Evil Lynch’ persona takes over. Lynch smacks Kane, who promptly pulls the van over and beats the hell out of him. Lynch doesn’t care until her realizes that Kane has taken his pill bottle. Lynch finally tells Kane that, he’s schizophrenic and has no memory of anything before three years ago. Kane gives him back his pills. 

Later, while Kane is stealing a truck, Lynch hears voices that tell him to escape. When Kane returns to the van where he had left Lynch, he finds it empty.

Meanwhile Carmikael has been informed of Kane’s ‘escape’ and has formed a task force that is working to catch him. They survey the scene of the ‘accident’ where the FBI is running point. Carmikael tells the FBI he doesn’t care about jurisdiction and expands his search to include Lynch.

Lynch has once again assumed his evil persona. He bursts into his old defense attorney’s office and assaults him. He claims the attorney intentionally lost the trial and demands to know who set him up. The attorney tells him, he was paid 50 grand to the throw the case, but he doesn’t know the guy’s name. The man had bluebird tattoo on his arm. Lynch stabs the attorney with a letter opener and escapes out the fire exit.

The area is crawling with mercenaries. As Lynch is fleeing, Kane pulls him aside and tells him if he wants to live he has to come with him. Kane engages the men amidst a crowd of businessmen. The fire fight is played out with both sides using silencers, the hiss of the bullets in the air, the only sound. Kane successfully leads Lynch out of the area and down a back alley. Just then, Russians in a Town Car bare down on them, Kane whirls around and shoots them dead. He pulls Lynch into the town car and they race off.

Carmikael's team gets a tip about the gun fight and descends on the area. They chase Kane, firing at will. Kane Returns, fire blowing out a police cruiser’s tires. Carmikael's van joins the pursuit. Kane returns fire, while Lynch drives and argues with voices in his head. Kane tosses a Russian corpse out of the car and shoots a grenade just as Carmikael's van is driving over it; crippling the van.

Kane and Lynch realize that one of the Russians in the car is still alive. They drive to secluded area in the desert and Kane tortures the Russian for information. They learn that Heathrow has set up a deal to sell a ‘Skeleton Key’ later that night in Mexico. The Russian then spins a bunch of lies, which Lynch catches him in. Evil Lynch beats him with a tire iron until Kane pulls him off. Kane yells at Lynch, until suddenly, Lynch pulls Kane’s gun and kills the Russian. Kane is mad until realizes that the Russian had gotten loose and was about to kill him.

Carmikael discovers that James Lynch is really Bishop Lynch a NSA Operative that went missing some years ago. He also finds out the Lynch’s last know operation directive as connected with ‘Red Charon;’ which is directly tied to the Skeleton Key. Carmikael has his men work on connecting Heathrow to Lynch.

Kane and Lynch wait in a hotel in Tijuana watching the area where the Russian said the exchange was going to go down; Lynch is now the evil persona and he really gets on Kane’s nerves. Once the buyer arrives, Kane and Lynch close in on the bar where the exchange is to take place. Kane slips a pill into some water he gives Lynch; the good Lynch returns. Kane tells Lynch to wait for him by the bar.

Heathrow sits in a back room snorting lines of coke, encircled by guards and his buyer, Valentin. Kane takes Heathrow hostage before anyone can react. Kane demands the skeleton key; it’s a standoff. Kane kills a guard, but then 5 more pop up behind him. Kane claims the place is crawling with his men and that he has a ‘point man’ waiting for his signal at the bar. They check down stairs and Kane realizes Lynch is missing. Kane lowers his gun.

Lynch has had another episode and argues with the evil persona. He thinks he sees his wife walk through the bar and chases after her. Then he’s approached by a prostitute but turns her down. She grabs his crotch and he pulls her hand off him. She calls for her pimp who pulls a knife on Lynch. Suddenly Lynch punches the pimp in the face. Another thug lunges at Lynch, who breaks a beer bottle and stabs him in the chest. Every thug in the place pulls a gun or knife. Lynch spots a gun on the dead Mexican and pulls it. BAM!

The sound of shots from inside the bar provides Kane the opportunity he needs. In a matter of seconds five gunmen and Heathrow lay dead. Kane sees Valentin disappear through the emergency exit. Kane opens the case on the table and removes the Skeleton Key. 

Kane rushes back into the bar to find Lynch a mad man biting a gangster’s ear off. He’s surrounded by bloody bodies; bullets flying everywhere. Lynch turns to Kane and tells him, he’s next. Kane knocks him out and drags him out of the bar.

Kane and evil Lynch have a bloody fist fight. During the brawl Lynch recovers some of his missing memories. Kane realizes that Lynch has been brain washed and programmed. Kane tells Lynch that he’s seen things similar to this before and he’ll help him figure out what’s going on. They escape into the night with the Skeleton Key.

Carmikael’s team finally figures out the Red Charon is connected to the Russians and an agent code-named Bluebird.

Kane works with Lynch in an internet cafe to turn on the Skeleton Key. Lynch suddenly becomes very robotic and begins spouting instructions to Kane. Lynch is the real Skeleton Key, the device Kane has is just trigger. Lynch continues spouting instructions until Kane interrupts him. Lynch passes out.

Merrick has Kane’s wife and daughter under guard at Red Charon headquarters. Kane calls Merrick and tells him he knows about Lynch; and if he wants to see him again he has to let his family go. Merrick won’t give in; he makes Kane watch via an i-phone video feed as he shoots Kane’s wife in front of Eliza. Merrick's tells Kane to bring Lynch or Eliza will be next.

Carmikael’s team finds out that Bluebird was running a project where they would use human couriers to move encrypted data. He is ex-NSA and pure Spook. Kane calls Carmikael and tells him he has the Skeleton Key, and he wants help bringing down Merrick. Carmikael is willing to help out, but he wants Lynch dead, for the safety of the country. Kane reluctantly agrees and tells Carmikael where the hand off with Merrick is to happen.

ACT III - Carmikael and his team have set up surveillance around Zocalo Square where the meeting is supposed to take place. The Russians have heard about it and sent a dozen agents into the area. Kane and Lynch wait in the crowded square with a small duffle bag.

Merrick shows up and Kane hands Lynch over to him. Lynch cannot believe that Kane is betraying him, but realizes that Kane does care about him. Valentine and the Russians show up, and demand that Lynch go with them. Suddenly, Lynch goes crazy; he pulls a gun and shoots a few of the Russians. Chaos ensues as the Russians, Merrick's gunmen and CIA agents trade gunfire. Kane begins dragging Lynch out of the fight when Valentin corners them; but before he can fire, Lynch impales Valentin with a metal shard. 

Kane rejoins the fire fight, spraying bullets into mercenaries and Russians. He has Lynch trigger a bomb they were carrying in the duffel bag. It explodes providing Lynch cover from CIA snipers who were about to blow his head off. Kane fights towards Merrick, taking a shot to the gut in the process. Kane sets off a secondary explosion in side a float, taking cover behind a wrecked car. There is a pause in the action, and Merrick realizes that Lynch is gone. He directs his men back to headquarters to guard Eliza. 

A guard tears at Eliza’s panties, when BAM! He’s shot in the head by Lynch. Lynch rushes Eliza into a waiting van and they take off. They are pursued by Merrick’s men. As they race past the square, Kane grabs a motorbike and joins the pursuit. They race through city streets, they exchange fire. 

Eliza takes the wheel and Lynch moves to the back to return fire. Merrick joins the chase firing at Kane. The van takes a tight turn and Lynch nearly falls out. Lynch swings around and shoots a biker in the face, throwing him off his bike. Kane rides up on the bike and guides it under Lynch. Lynch tells Kane to ride up and take care of his daughter, he’ll handle Merrick.

Lynch rides up in front of Merrick’s jeep and slams on his breaks, throwing him onto the hood. He then shoots the driver in the head and the jeeps crashes. Kane speeds to the van which is riddled with holes, smoking and nearly out of control. Kane climbs in the van and holds his daughter as they make a crash landing through a roadblock and into the Tijuana slums. 

Eliza is okay, but Kane is still bleeding from his abdomen and banged up from the wreck. Just as they’ve pulled themselves out of the car, Merrick appears. He takes Eliza by the neck and puts a gun to her head. Then Lynch shows up, gun aimed at Merrick. Merrick promises to tell Lynch the truth about his past if he kills Kane. Lynch fights with the voices in his head that want him to kill Kane. The good lynch wins out, he takes the first shot at Merrick, followed by Kane; Merrick dies. Lynch decides to track down the rest of the people responsible for brain washing him; he and Kane part ways.

Carmikael breaks up the Skeleton Key that Kane got from Heathrow; then re-arrests Kane. Six months later, Kane is in prison, but not on death row. Carmikael comes to visit him. They spotted Lynch in Venice, and would like to ask him a favor.

COMMENTS
I think Hannibal has an output in Middle East, but that’s the only territory I think this would be interesting; (although, there is random flippant racist remarks made about the “quran” and terrorists, in the jingoistic terms common to 2002 cops in NYC). The story had a second rate “goodfellas” feel and doesn’t seem much better or more interesting than the myriad cop shows that flood the American airwaves. Despite the strong cast there was nothing that made me feel particularly interested and this isn’t the strongest film of this genre that I’ve read… even the forgotten New Line film PRIDE AND GLORY was a much better script than this. I’d say stay away.

LOGLINE

An aging Hollywood action hero is desperate to reinvigorate his waning career and therefore convinced by his agent to accept a prestigious invitation to star in the British Theatre playing King Lear at Stratford…only the Stratford in question is Stratford St John, a sleepy Suffolk village. And the theatre is an old barn, which the villagers want to save from closure by putting on a charity performance.

COMMENTS

Script is plagued by a dearth of laughs and a predictable plot.  Steel’s character is completely aggravating, and the bits poking fun at show biz aren’t particularly insightful, amusing or unique.  The fish out of water plot is a complete retread, and the aspect of the script that should have been its strength – the Shakespeare, somehow came off dull and flat.   Pass.


SUMMARY

JEFFERSON STEEL, a washed up B movie actor who fancies himself to be a peer of Jack Nicholson and Marlon Brando is really more akin to Bruce Campbell, but without any trace of self reflective irony.  His macho routine is running dry as he reaches his late fifties, and he is desperate for a role.  His manager SAMMY, an old Hollywood type, is also desperate – Jefferson is his only client and after Steel’s film “Ultimate Finality 3” flops, the horizon looks barren.

The only offer that does come in is for the lead role of KING LEAR in a British Theater.  Sammy talks Jefferson into taking the job after insisting, truthfully, that there’s absolutely nothing else available.  Thinking that he’ll gain the cache of Olivier or Branaugh, Steel reluctantly agrees, but is horrified when he finds that the play is not being performed by the Royl Shakespeare Company, but is in fact being put on by a rural Community theater company (the titular “bunch of amateurs) who have contacted Steel in the hopes that the high profile actor will be able to save their financially troubled theater. 

Jefferson is irritated by everything associated with his new job.  He is picked up from the airport in a Volvo rather than a limo.  He has no trailer, and worse, his accommodations are in a homey bed and breakfast rather than a luxurious hotel. Jefferson decides to quit, but Sammy informs him that he’s getting great publicity for performing the charity event and trying to “save theater.”

DOROTHY, the matter of fact director of the play, MARY the star struck bed & breakfast proprietor and NIGEL, the jealous actor envious of Steel’s lead role, all butt heads with the childish, obnoxious Hollywood star.  Steel demands luxurious foods, hardly knows his lines and insults the local lifestyle every waking moment.  

Dorothy and some of the other cast members soothe his aggression by turning the town’s mobile library into a makeshift trailer, and the sentiment melts Steel’s heart. He and Dorothy’s relationship gets closer, he even attempts to kiss her at one part, but she manages to keep him at arm’s length. 

During a workout session with LAUREN, the local sports enthusiast who also happens to be the wife of the play’s sponsor, Bill, MARY mistakes the noises of a massage for extramarital shenanigans.  Mary spreads gossip that Jefferson and Lauren have slept together and promptly throws Jefferson out of the bed & breakfast.  After the paparazzi pick up on the story, Dorothy throws him out of the play and worse, the sponsor pulls all the funding.  The actors resign themselves to the fact that Nigel will star as Lear in the final show the theater will ever be able to stage.  

Jefferson manages to convince Dorothy that he didn’t sleep with Lauren.  He and the actors use the paparazzo’s naiveté to raise funding and interest in the show by planting absurd rumors about Steel’s sexual antics.  The newfound publicity lands Jefferson a choice role in a TV miniseries, but Jefferson turns it down to remain in the play, which opens to rave reviews.

LOGLINE

When Betty Ann Water’s brother Kenny gets sent to prison for a crime he didn’t commit, Betty devotes her life to proving his innocence.

COMMENTS

Like ERIN BROCKOVITCH lite, this courtroom drama pulls at the heart strings, but the story does not feel very theatrical.  It’s far easier to picture as a TV movie on Lifetime or Hallmark than a theatrical film.  It’s a good part for SWANK in that it’s very easy to root for the main character and there are a few moments that will really appeal to family audiences, but the writing isn’t spectacular.  Decent adaptation, ok for popcorn audiences and fans of Swank, but it does not have the same quality of writing of Million Dollar Baby, Erin Brockovitch, etc.– only if you think it will work for TV.


SUMMARY

Film opens on grisly imagery of a bloody crime scene.  Cops find the dead body of an elderly woman lying on the floor of her bedroom.

1966.  Betty Ann wrestles her older brother Kenny.  After much struggle the tough little girl actually gets the best of him. Betty and Kenny live with their mother ELIZABETH.  They are a poor family, and the kids are largely unsupervised.  Betty and Kenny like to break into homes to “play house.”  Betty and Kenny break into the home of MS. BROW.  After they trash the place, the cops apprehend Kenny.  “Kids did this?” The boy violently fights back, hurting a few of the police officers.  Kenny is sent to juvenile home.

1995.  Betty, in her 30s, enlists in law school.  She quickly befriends the other “old woman” in class, ABRA.  Betty tells Abra that she enrolled in order to become a lawyer and help get her brother Kenny out of jail.   “My brother’s been in jail for 12 years.  He’s innocent.”

Flashback.  Betty Ann marries RICK.  Kenny doesn’t approve of the marriage,  The night of the wedding, Betty Ann’s grandfather dies.  At the funeral, cops bust in and arrest Rick for the murder of MS. BROW.  Kenny, sure that he’s innocent, hired the public defender, but the prosecution brings a bunch of witnesses who testify that Kenny admitted to the crime.  

1995. Betty is struggling to juggle her court case, her law school courses and her parenting.  She has split from Rick and he wants custody of the kids, insisting (correctly) that Betty is too busy. Her two sons eventually move in with their father.  Betty is devastated but Abra comes to her aid, convincing her to keep fighting for Kenny’s freedom.  

Betty passes the BAR exam and begins searching for the evidence from Kenny’s old case, hoping that the DNA evidence can exonerate him.  Betty finds out that the evidence has been destroyed.  She insists the court employees search the warehouse again and again with the slim hope of a miracle.  Eventually Betty and Abra head to the court themselves and are relieved when the blood samples are found in a dusty corner of the warehouse.  “That’s my brother’s LIFE in there.” 

Betty receives a call from a high profile lawyer BARRY, who runs the “Innocence Project.” Barry agrees to help with the case despite his incredibly long backlog of cases.  The DNA test is being held up by the prosecution who don’t want to be outed for accidentally incarcerating Kenny. Again taking matters into her own hands, Betty heads to the lab and demands that the test be expedited.  The test proves that Kenny could not be the murderer. Betty and Kenny are elated, but the good news dies quickly: The prosecutor is holding Kenny in prison and claiming that he could be an accessory to the murder. They will need new evidence to prove his innocence. 

Betty, Abra and Barry reopen the investigation.  Betty manages to get Kenny’s ex wife to admit that she framed Kenny.  Kenny’s daughter MANDY is shocked. 

The case is dismissed and Kenny is freed.  He reunites with his daughter.  Betty continues her work with the Innocence Project to this day.

LOGLINE

Remake of the film 13 Tzameti about a man in search of money who unwittingly signs up to enter a gambling ring of high stakes investors who bet on an elaborate game of Russian Roulette.

COMMENTS

A remake of the film that premiered at Berlin 06, and opened recently in the US, the English Language remake seems to be in the spirit of the original, featuring a claustrophobic feel, a dark tone and a harsh, amoral sensibility. In terms of the script alone I think Babluani hasn’t strayed too far from his original and this has the potential to be gripping and controversial.  The characters are starkly drawn, VINCE the only one with any real back story, but the family moments never veer too far into melodrama; there are some shocking images and the tension of the roulette is palpable on the page.  Exciting, cool script. The attachments are interesting as well, this is worth looking at. 

SUMMARY

JEFFERSON gets kidnapped and taken out  of a prison with the warden’s help.  

VINCE, a blue collar guy and family man lives with his father, mother and sister and the family is reeling after falling on financial hard times.  VINCE works on a construction job repairing the roof of a troubled, heroine addicted mid-fifties man named WILLIAM.  WILLIAM is broke, but assures his young lover AILEEN that he’ll be “getting a lot of money real soon.”  WILLIAM’s house is being staked out by detectives. VINCE overhears WILLIAM talking to his buddy BLARO about his fast money scheme, “Jesus, you’re making that much in one day?” but WILLIAM is cagey about the details. 

When Vince’s father NICK falls off the roof and gets badly injured, the family is more desperately in need of money than ever. 

JEFFERSON, meanwhile, is being driven to a mysterious location.  He begs to be set free, and offers to bribe the DRIVER, but the driver refuses wisely, “what good is money going to do me against people with enough power to get you out of a place like that?” 

JASPER checks his brother RONALD LYNN out of a mental hospital, brings him to a motel and hires a hooker for him.  Meanwhile, JASPER gets an investor to stake him $1.2 Million. 

WILLIAM receives  a STRIPED ENVELOPE in the mail, “I got what I was waiting for, I leave tomorrow.” William takes a heroine rig, locks himself in a bathroom and promptly overdoses.  AILEEN screams for help and VINCE bashes the door down, finding WILLIAM dead.  VINCE steals the STRIPED ENVELOPE. 

VINCE takes a train to CHICAGO  (JASER and RONALD LYNN are aboard the same train). He receives instructions to find a locker number in which he finds a cardboard number 13 and instructions about a rendezvous.  He’s picked up by a driver and taken to a remote estate in the woods of Illinois. 

VINCE pretends like he knows what’s going on as he’s strip searched by a security team and admitted into the estate despite carrying a cell phone. VINCE meets his handlers JOE and MARK and tells them that WILLIAM is dead and that he came hoping to get money.  JOE and MARK reluctantly let VINCE participate.  “You have to play now.” 

VINCE is lead into a ballroom in the mansion  where GAMBLERS, HANDLERS, PLAYERS and MONEY MEN mill about.  VINCE mingles awkwardly with the other players who include JEFFERSON and RONALD LYNN. The players are all dressed in identical grey tee shirts marked with their individual numbers (VINCE is “13”). The gamblers and handlers bet their wages in the hundreds of thousands of dollars per go; and the rules are laid out: each PLAYER is given a revolver with three bullets.  The players stand in a circle and put the gun to the base of the head of the man in front of them, forming a morbid circlular Russian roulette.  A bare light bulb dangles in the middle of the circle.  When the light bulb is switched on, the men fire.  Immediately a handful of men drop dead.  VINCE survives, but a HANDLER realizes that he has not fired his weapon at HANS, the man in front of him.  The GUARDS threaten to kill VINCE if he doesn’t fire.  He finally pulls the trigger; his gun is empty.  HANS screams with relief.

In between rounds the players fight anxiety by taking morphine or chugging whiskey.  VINCE declines both.  In the second round the men are given a gun with four bullets and only two empty chambers. The man behind VINCE is killed and VINCE survives.  “You’re pretty lucky, the bullet is in the chamber.  He didn’t have time to shoot.” 

JEFFERSON tries to talk his handler JIMMY into letting him go, offering to bribe JIMMY with a million dollars.  “You have a better chance of surviving in the ring.”  Jefferson writes down the location of the money on a map and gives it to Jimmy, making the handler promise to split the loot with JEFFERSON’s daughter. 

Before the third round HANS, who has already killed two players in the first two rounds, is so terrified that his handler sedates him and pushes him into the ring. In the third round, three more are killed including HANS, leaving only six players including VINCE, JEFFERSON and RONALD LYNN.

The final round consists of a duel between only two players.  After drawing lots, VINCE and RONALD LYNN are pitted to square off against each other for the biggest pay day while JEFFERSON is finished, allowed to collect his winnings and leave after the final round.  He has survived.

In the duel, VINCE and RONALD are given guns with three bullets and three free chambers.  The two men pull the trigger and each get empty cylinders.  They reset and square off again.  RONALD fires, empty, VINCE fires and shoots RONALD in the head.  “The winner is number thirteen.”  

VINCE collects his money and sees JIMMY strangling JEFFERSON to death.  VINCE runs away.   VINCE, shellshocked, runs through a forest until he winds up in a town.  He eats at a diner.  COPS approach so VINCE stashes his backpack of money under a table.   The COPS question him but VINCE insists that he never made it to the secret mansion and claims to know nothing about it.  Reluctantly, the cops let him go.  VINCE retrieves the money and mails it home to his mother. On the train home, JASPER sees VINCE.  JASPER shoots and kills VINCE.

COMMENTS:
Post-apocalyptic movies about a small group of survivors making their way through a country ravaged by a plague are almost a genre to themselves (though many involve a plague that turns its victims into monsters to menace the protagonists).  CARRIERS doesn’t have any zombies, but it follows the other conventions faithfully—the group is narrowed by violence, one member gets infected but keeps it a secret, they slowly begin to turn on one another.  There are some good moments of chills—the child-killing doctor, the encounter with suited gunmen, and the man-eating dog attack.  The downer ending fits with the genre, and feels earned if unpleasant.  Without clearer external antagonists, though, the movie becomes someone frustrating watching the core group of characters turn on each other while making silly mistakes convenient to the plot.  A few more external monsters would have made this more of a thriller, and more appealing to audiences. 

STEVE COMMENTS 

I found this pretty gripping actually,  film is I think complete so it would be best to watch something, but this could be good for INDO at least, although could run into some censorship issues. 

SUMMARY:
A horrible virus has decimated the world, infecting and killing most of the population.  A quartet of young people has managed to survive, staying on the road in the American West.  BOBBY is a smart-ass but good with car mechanics, and he has developed the rules by which they survive—avoid populated areas, stay on back roads, always wear gloves and dust masks, assume any strangers are infected, leave the sick (they’re already dead), and take what you need and never look back.  His younger brother DANNY is sometimes torn by these rules, but follows his brother’s lead, while BOBBY, Brian’s girlfriend and KATE, another young woman they picked up, both fall into line with Brian’s rules.  The group is traveling to Turtle Beach, a vacation place from Brian and Danny’s childhood, to wait out the epidemic when they run into a Suburban vehicle in the middle of the desert.  FRANK asks them to borrow gas, but they notice he is hiding JODIE, his six-year-old infected daughter, in his car.  When Brian crashes the car trying to run away, he pulls his pistol on Frank and steals their vehicle, quarantining Frank and Jodie in the back with a plastic divider.

They go to an old school Frank says is the location of doctors who have developed a cure.  While Brian, Danny, Kate, and Frank venture in to find this, Bobby stays in the car with Jodie, who has a coughing fit.  Trying to help her, Bobby is splashed with blood, but keeps it a secret from the others.  Inside the school, they find only sick children and one sick doctor euthanizing them. As they leave this horror, Brian forces out Frank and Jodie, abandoning them there since “the sick are already dead.”

The group stops at an abandoned country club and starts to play around in it.  Danny tries to kiss Kate, but she continues to refuse his advances.  Bobby holds to the hope that she has not been infected, even as she tries to keep her distance from boyfriend Brian.  When a group of gunmen turns out to be occupying the country club as well, they try to drive Brian and Danny away while not allowing the girls to leave.  They make the girls strip, but in doing so Bobby reveals a rash that betrays her infection.  The gunmen force the whole group to leave the country club.  

Bobby is quarantined in the back of the suburban.  Torn, Brian throws Bobby out of the car at the next stop and abandons her, after Kate and Danny remind him of his rules.  Still distraught, Brian turns violent shortly later when they encounter two middle-aged women who don’t want to give them some gas.  Brian shoots them both, though he is wounded in the leg.  Danny with his EMT training cares for Brian, and they stop at a house to get medical supplies.  In the house, a dog attacks Danny when he interrupts it from feasting on its dead owner.  Danny manages to shoot the dog, but when he prepares to dress Brian’s wound, he sees a rash showing that Brian has also been infected.  Kate presses Danny to follow the rules and leave Brian.  While Brian is sleeping, Danny manages to get the pistol from him, but doesn’t get the correct car keys.  Brian awakes and tells Danny he’ll have to kill him or not abandon him.  Danny shoots Brian.

Danny and Kate arrive at Turtle Beach, which is completely abandoned.  Danny is like the walking dead now—after killing his brother, he has no apparent emotions.  He rapes Kate off screen, then goes and sits in the surf, bobbing in the waves with no feeling left as we are reminded of the rules of survival that have turned him into this creature.

COMMENTS – SW
This script is lovely and endearing.  It hits the right notes to make the audience feel for these kids who come from different circumstances in Africa and learn what it means to be a team.  This feels to me sort of like an African SLUM DOG however the story is not as powerful for me.  I like the fact that there is a bond between a rich Rwandan kid who is actually the amazing footballer and his poor Rwandan buddy who is uneducated and acts as his manager.  The two kids they pick up along the way both come from much tougher backgrounds – we are made aware of what these two have been through but do not dwell on the horrors they have experienced.  This is definitely a feel-good film however with 5 kids/teens as the protagonists I am not sure who exactly the audience is for this.  Clearly it is being done and coming out in time for the 2010 World Cup – it has a lot of heart but in reality, the story is far from realistic, though we do root for these kids to succeed on their journey.  Like OPAL DREAM, it has a bittersweet ending.  I think if you like the story in buy into it you know what the film is going to be.   The backdrop through Africa is absolutely gorgeous.  Director is a first-timer who has won a couple of awards for her first short WE ARE ALL RWANDANS – the question is can she work with child actors.  Not 100% convinced on this one unless you know that the subject matter will bring them to the theaters in each territory.

MW COMMENTS
I agree with Susan. I suggest we look at this director's short.

SUMMARY (from Pathé with editorial by SW)
On the way to the vital football selection trial, disaster strikes when Fabrice, Dudu and Beatrice board the wrong bus and cross into the Congo; without papers, money or a believable story, they are escorted to a UNICEF refugee camp. But with considerable ingenuity and sass (and a World Cup wall chart for a map), our pint-sized heroes escape the camp, with the help of a new tough-guy friend, and set off through the endless horizons of Africa in pursuit of their dream, picking up along the way a “dream team” of displaced kids – one girl is a teen aged sex worker, another a former child soldier, from all different backgrounds, who help them negotiate a series of glorious, dangerous and hilarious adventures.
 
Through their epic 3000 mile journey, we encounter an Africa few people have ever seen; experience a kaleidoscopic adventure through seven countries; and feel the joy, laughter and hope that comes from making an incredible journey together. AFRICA UNITED is a dramatic, heartfelt and enchanting story set to enthrall audiences worldwide.
 
The film is a UK/South African co-production and is produced by Mark Blaney, Jackie Sheppard and Eric Kabera alongside co-producers Mark Hubbard and Lance Armstrong.

LOGLINE 

After being fired from a job at a call center, Charlie, a man with a skill for memorizing factoids, but a problem holding jobs, decides to team with Gus, a wacky coworker, to blackmail a reverend that likes porn.

SUMMARY

CHARLIE’s memory is fading due to a strange illness.  He memorizes inane facts as a method for fighting off his inevitable decline into blank memory.  Despite his encyclopedic knowledge of factoids, Charlie has a hard time supporting his family.  He used to be a professor, and according to his wife, PENELOPE, quite a good one.  Penelope, the head detective of the Big Falls Police Department, is basically supporting Charlie and his daughter EMILY.  Penelope’s father in law gets Charlie a job at the local “call center,” a customer service job that provides telephone support for DSL customers.

Charlie’s first day on the job he is surprised to learn that he is not a supervisor, like he understood, but an operator.  He meets GUS, a wacky coworker who likes to mute calls and insult the callers.  When Charlie tries this stunt, he realizes the mute button on his phone is busted and the caller has heard everything.  Charlie gets fired.

Gus feels badly about Charlie’s firing, holding himself partially responsible.  He tells Charlie that he has a plan to make money.  Charlie is hesitant about turning to a life of crime.  His wife, who has been stressed at work due to the fact that a notorious killer “The Oregon Undertaker” is on the loose, is no help.  She tells him that if he hypothetically turned to a life of crime, she would arrest him.

That night, at the local pub, Gus lays out the plan: Gus has obtained access to a list of all web surfers in the area who surf porn.  His plan is to blackmail a local reverend for 100,000 dollars in exchange for not revealing to his constituents that he is a pervert. JOSIE, a girl who had a brief fling with Gus, overhears the plan and cuts herself  in.  She is going to make the call.  Gus is going to go to the house and get the money.  Charlie is going to come to the bar and provide an alibi for Gus.

Josie makes the call, and when the Reverend balks at giving them 100,000 dollars, she doubles the price.  The next night, after a day of severe nervousness for Charlie, Gus goes to the house for the drop.  When Charlie’s alibi falls apart, he rushes to the house to tell Gus.  He sees the Reverend lying in the floor in a pool of blood, and assumes that Gus killed him. Charlie panics, desperately leaves a message for Josie, and drags the Reverends body out back, dumping it into a septic tank.  Gus startles Charlie.  He has been here the whole time.  He explains what happened – the Reverend pulled a gun, so Gus knocked him out – but didn’t kill him.  Charlie killed him when he dumped him into the septic tank.

In the house, the two men find a box of DVD’s that look like snuff films, made by the perverted Reverend.  A cop comes to the door.  Gus hides.  The cop assumes Charlie is a member of the Reverend’s family, and tells him that the Reverend has been killed.  Charlie and Gus realize that the man they killed wasn’t the Reverend at all.   The Cop is suspicious of the blood on the floor, and the tracks in the backyard.  When he asks to look in the septic tank, Gus knocks him out and handcuffs him.  Just then, Mrs. Donaghue, the Reverend’s wife returns.  She admits to shooting her husband and tells them that she was supposed to meet her lover at the house, and the two were going to run off with 2 million dollars.  Mrs. Donaghue is about to kill Gus, Charlie and the Deputy, when Josie walks in and smashes an axe into her head.  Josie finds the money in the oven, and the two make a plan to escape with it.  The deputy tries to escape, so Josie force feeds him vodka to get him wasted.  They tie him up in the bathroom.  He tries to climb out of the bathroom, but falls and breaks his neck.  

They hatch a plan to make it look like the deputy and Mrs. Donaghue died in a car accident.  They load the bodies into the trunk of their car, but Mrs. Donaghue’s body falls out.  The cops show up – Charlie’s wife Penelope.  She is pissed at him, and a little suspicious, but they all lie and say they were coming back from having some drinks after work.   They tell her that they accidentally ran over the body, but have no idea how it got in the street.  Emily, Charlie’s daughter, is asleep in the backseat of the car, because Charlie wasn’t home to babysit.  Penelope and a Federal Agent HYMES take them down to the station and question them, but don’t seem to suspect that they killed Mrs. Donaghue.

After they leave the station they try to dump the Deputies body in the swamp.  Hymes catches them.  Hymes kills Gus.  Josie kills Hymes by force feeding him sugar – he’s a diabetic.  Josie kills Charlie, but Charlie dies with a smile on his face because he switched bags at the station, and gave the 2 million dollars to his wife.

COMMENTS

A black comedy that is so gruesome I was actually shocked.  The script starts off like a nice simple comedy, but by the time the criminal acts start to transpire it has taken a sharp left turn into VERY BAD THINGS territory.  The script is intentionally stupid, the violence is at the same time shocking and irreverently played for laughs.  The main character is an annoying pain in the neck, and the casting of David Schwimmer will no doubt accentuate that.  Gus was a fun character who will no doubt provide some laughs.  My favorite sequence was the sequence where Charlie’s wife hauls them down the station and they are casually questioned.  I feel like this was the only part of the film where the comedy and dark subject matter congealed, and the tone of the filmmaker’s humor finally made sense and hit some pitch perfect notes.  The rest of the script, unfortunately was decidedly off key, and the laughs came too few and too far in between.  Not recommended for a prebuy.

In AD 117 the Roman Empire sends the legendary 9th legion under General Titus Virilus to northern Britain to conquer the Picts, a pagan sect intent on fighting a guerilla war to protect their land.

COMMENTS
This is essentially a chase/buddy picture. The 9th legion is immediately defeated leaving a small band of brothers behind enemy lines being relentlessly perused through the English countryside. Although there is some witty repartee this is a predictable story with little to recommend and will rely solely on execution for success. It will have to be extremely well made with compelling stars to be successful.

SUMMARY
MARCUS DIAZ, a Roman soldier, is stationed in the most northern garrison of the British frontier when GORLACON and his army of Picts attack it. MARCUS, the lone Roman survivor is captured by the Picts, interrogated, and sent back to the Roman’s with a message of warning.  The Roman response is to send it’s most successful general, TITUS VIRILUS, into the fray to destroy the Picts who have waged a successful guerilla war. 
MARCUS becomes friendly with TITUS and acts as translator and Pict specialist. TITUS, unfamiliar with the Pict’s tactics, leads the 9th into an ambush. The Romans are defeated, TITUS captured, and the seven Roman survivors seek to free their general. 
MARCUS, as the highest ranking soldier, leads the group consisting of BOTHOS, a big loyal soldier who’s not too bright but all heart, THAX, devious and bloodthirsty, BRICK, the grizzled veteran on his last tour, LEONIDAS, slight of build and armed with a slingshot, BRUCHNAUR, a cook, and KLYTUS, a survivor more interested in saving himself than all else. 
The group’s first objective is to free TITUS, which they fail to do and THAX stupidly kills the son of GORLACON, the giant leader of the Picts. TITUS is executed and GORLACON sends ETIAN, the female tracker who betrayed the Roman’s and helped lead them into the ambush to hunt the Romans down. The chase begins, ETIAN is relentless and clever, MARCUS cannot shake her and his men begin to mutiny. BRUCHNAUR falls to Pict arrows, LEONIDAS to ETIAN’s spear, BOTHOS is wounded and THAX and KLYTUS separated from the group. 
MARCUS discovers a cabin in the woods and leads his exhausted men to shelter. The owner of the cabin, ISMENE, has been branded a witch by the Picts and banished. ISMENE hides the Romans and helps clean BOTHOS’s wounded leg. MARCUS and a lonely 	ISMENE make love before the group sets out for a nearby Roman outpost mentioned by ISMENE.
THAX and KLYTUS are being pursued by wolves and are too tired to continue running. When the wolves begin to move in for the kill, THAX cuts KLYTUS’ leg, lamming him and leaving him to the wolf pack. MARCUS leads his men to the outpost but it is abandoned with a note leaving forwarding directions. ETIAN and her PICTS attack the outpost. BRICK is killed and MARCUS kills ETIAN.  THAX is reunited with MARCUS and BOTHOS and the group heads for the new outpost. When they arrive BOTHOS is mistaken for a Pict and killed by the outpost guards. THAX betrays and attacks MARCUS to hide his crimes of killing the boy and KLYTUS. MARCUS defeats THAX and reaches the outpost. 
When the governor of Britain, AGRICOLA, and his cunning wife DRUSILLA learn of the humiliating defeat of the 9th legion it is decided that MARCUS should be murdered so that news of this can be kept from Rome. MARCUS smells the trap and escapes back to ISMENE and they live happily ever after.

COMMENTS 
I just finished the script and I like it very much. It is very beautiful and moving. I understand the character, and I was completely engrossed in the story. When the phone rang, I actually jumped, I was so into his world.

I love the important role music plays into the script. That will add such an interesting dimension. I love that this character is an Alice Cooper/ Ozzy Osbourne kind of character. This will actually help get the young boys in the cinema. My 15 year old son is in love with Ozzy.

For some reason, I kept thinking about Into The Wild. I know they are completely different, but nonetheless, that is the movie that kept popping into mind. In that film, I also found the music to have a role, and it was a
man on a lonely quest.

My father was a holocaust survivor. I am critical of these stories. This one rings true.

There is much depression in the film, but I actually found this story to be very uplifting in the end. It was insightful and inspiring. And different! I really loved it.


SUMMARY 
BRITAIN. 
CHEYENNE is a retired musician still dressing like a goth icon from the 1980s; in the vein of an aging ROBERT SMITH.  CHEYENNE is friends with a sad seventeen year old girl MARY; MARY and her mother are disconsolate over the loss of Mary’s brother, who disappeared three months prior.  CHEYENNE tries to play matchmaker, arranging for MARY and awkward local clerk DESMOND to go on a date. MARY is not into it. 

CHEYENNE seems depressed, often prone to bouts of staring at his own reflection, seemingly ignorant of his surroundings.  His wife JANE is supportive of him and despite his depression and loneliness, it is clear the two are still in love. 

CHEYENNE and MARY make a trip to a local cemetery where they run into an aging couple who reprimand CHEYENNE; “how many times do we have to tell you that you are NOT welcome at our son’s graves!?”

A young rocker, STEPHEN, asks CHEYENNE to produce his album.  The band’s name is The Pieces of Shit. “Good name.” 

MARY and DESMOND come over for dinner but Mary gets upset when Desmond makes a tasteless comment.  MARY’s mother has a breakdown and walks out into traffic; despondent over missing son. 

CHEYENNE gets word that his estranged father, in America, is dying. CHEYENNE decides, reluctantly, to go back home.  He tries to fly, but is too terrified, so he takes a boat.  The journey takes so long that Cheyenne’s father has passed away by the time Cheyenne arrives.  “Traffic.” 

Cheyenne hangs out with David Byrne, a long time friend, and opens up about his own melancholy and admits that he thinks that two kids in britain killed themselves because of his lyrics.  

A Nazi Hunter, Mordecai Levy, arrives at Cheyenne’s father’s funeral.  Cheyenne’s cousin tells him that Cheyenne’s father had spent his entire adult life chasing ALOISE MUELLER, a guard at Aushwitz, where Cheyenne’s father had been imprisoned during the holocaust. 

CHEYENNE begins to use his father’s journal as a clue to track down the Nazi.  Cheyenne lies to his wife JANE and tells her that he will be coming home soon; but winds up borrowing a pickup truck from a stranger and beginning a cross country search. 

Cheyenne finds Aloise’s wife, an aging but still sharp DOROTHY.  She seems suspicious of his story that he’s an old student of hers.  Cheyenne sneaks back into her house and finds a lead – a drawing from her great grandson TOMMY MUELLER, and a location. 

Cheyenne finds RACHEL and TOMMY MUELLER; Aloise’s granddaughter and great grandson.  He befriends the sad and lonely Rachel, and manages to find out the whereabouts of Aloise.  He buys a pool for Tommy and has a crew install it.  Rachel never finds out that Cheyenne is looking for her grandfather.  She, in fact, has no idea that her grandfather was a nazi.

Cheyenne buys a gun.

Cheyenne finds Aloise’s house, but the man has packed up and disappeared.   (He was tipped off by Dorothy) Devastated, Cheyenne gets drunk (he’s been years sober).  He calls Stephen in the UK and tells him that he’ll produce his record. (He’s been listening to the CD during the entire trip.)  

Mordecai, the Nazi Hunter, tracks down Cheyenne.  “You were hard to find.” He tells him that Aloise has run to Canada and the two go in search of him together; finding him in a small cottage.  Cheyenne finally confronts the Nazi.  Aloise, an old, feeble man, tells him that his father’s persistence was to avenge a humiliation in the camp – Aloise laughed at Cheyenne’s father after he peed his pants in the camp.  His father spent his entire life avenging that humiliation, going so far as to send a package bomb that blew off Aloise’s right hand and forearm.  Cheyenne doesn’t kill Aloise, but humiliates him by making him crawl into the snow naked. 

Cheyenne returns home, finally taking off the makeup of his youth, finally growing up.

COMMENTS
This was an interesting attempt at finding horror in one’s own backyard, but confusion rather than terror was the principal impression left from this script. While the core premise – a respected member of the community torturing a woman in his home and compelling his family to participate – holds some promise, multiple subplots were thrown in and subsequently abandoned or abruptly revived with no attempt at explanation: a deformed pet child kept in a doghouse, Chris potentially having raped his daughter, and how a cannibal tribe managed to persist in this day and age so close to American suburbia. (Maybe this was explained in the preceding film, but it is only obliquely referenced to in this script and not even pondered by any of the Cleek family.)

Even more puzzling at times is Chris’ character. He holds potential as a creepy villain hiding in plain sight, but his sadism and misogynistic ways seem like statements of fact with no origin or motivation. His rant at the climax against women is too little too late and wholly insufficient as a driver for his evilness. A man that twisted would still live by some personal code or set of ideals, but there is little consistency in his intentions, actions and words to illustrate that. We get that he’s bad, but the exact gradient of his wickedness is blurred. That being said, it was difficult to get this script out of my mind after reading it, but it was due to confusion as much as it was due to the chilling premise. PASS.

SYNOPSIS
A feral injured WOMAN wandering the coastline slays a wolf with a blade and inhabits its cave. In her sleep, flashes of violent memories surface, including that of her deceased primitive clan and a dead infant, presumably hers. Meanwhile, the CLEEK family is attending a suburban barbeque – self-assured and well-respected CHRIS (40), his demure wife BELLE, sullen but pretty daughter PEGGY (16), sly BRIAN (13) and little DARLIN’ (4). Chris, a lawyer, helps his neighbors out and appears to be a good country family man who keeps his wife in line.

On a hunting excursion the next day, Chris spies the Woman bathing and catching fish with a spear in the stream by her cave. Fascinated by her wildness, he recruits his family to clear out the external fruit cellar by their house, then returns to the Woman’s cave at dawn and captures her with a net and a blow to the head. He manacles her to a wall in the cellar, but she manages to bite part of his finger off in the process. Chris threatens her with a pistol before bringing his family in to see their new pet. Peggy is horrified and Brian is delighted. Chris orders them to take turns feeding and cleaning up after his pets: the Woman, his vicious pet dogs in the barn, and a mysterious doglike creature that stays holed up in the doghouse. Belle objects to keeping the Woman captive until Chris smacks her face.

Over the next few days, Chris goes to work as usual and the kids attend school. Well-intentioned teacher Miss RATON notices Peggy might be pregnant – she suffers from nausea and has taken to wearing baggy clothes. “Domesticating” the Woman in the cellar becomes part of their routine, except for Peggy who strongly objects and Darlin’ who is kept away. Brian drills a peephole in the cellar wall to spy on her. They scald her with hot water to bathe her, then use a pressure washer on her body. The Woman nearly manages several times to attack Chris, but Brian and Belle threaten and beat her back. One night, Chris goes so far as to rape the now broken but stoic Woman while Brian peeps on them. 

The next day, thinking everyone is out, Brian sneaks into the cellar to rape the Woman like his father did, but a horrified Peggy chases him out and helps the Woman cover herself, apologizing for her family’s actions. She rats out Brian to her parents – Chris reacts with paternal glee to his son’s masculinity, horrifying Belle who tries to take her daughters and leave. Chris snaps and knocks his wife out just before Miss Raton comes by to inform him of Peggy’s pregnancy. She asks who the father is, and a high-strung Chris asks if she suspects him of impregnating his own daughter before knocking a bewildered Miss Raton unconscious. 

A terrified Peggy watches as her father ties up Miss Raton and drags her into the barn with his dogs, Brian on his tail. Peggy grabs the keys to the cellar and runs out, as Belle comes to. Belle hides Darlin’ in her room before following Peggy. Miss Raton fights for her life against the dogs as Chris and Brian watch. Then, out of the doghouse, the mysterious creature emerges – a deformed feral girl (the CHILD) more ferocious than any of the dogs. She finishes Miss Raton off in a bloodbath. Meanwhile, Peggy frees the Woman who gently touches the younger girl’s swollen belly before spotting Belle. The Woman pins Belle and eats off her face, then grabs a lawn mower blade and enters the barn where she cuts Brian down and slices Chris up the middle, devouring his liver and heart. She calms the feral Child down by feeding her some of Chris’ organs. They follow a fleeing Peg and Darlin’ into the field, but rather than attack them, the Woman offers each girl a taste of their father’s blood as a peace offering. Then all four women disappear into the woods together.

Reads like a video title and I dont recommend it to the other clients; but for middle east IF Heather Graham means anything, its actually kind of breezy, commercial seeming fun; it reads like a knockoff version of sex and the city, and to that end, does a pretty good job cramming in some fun dialog and humor based on the interaction between the drinking, fun loving NY girls and the drinking, fun loving Irish peoples.  I expected it to be terrible but was pleasantly surprised; I dont see this getting a theatrical release in the US, but for the right price it could have vid/ tv value.

COMMENTS
Filled with vicious people that are as pitiable as they are detestable, this emotionally turbulent drama is driven by characters who screw each other and screw each other over. And just as they near the brink of becoming unredeemable, they surprise the reader/viewer with an odd moment of humanity or vulnerability. Georges Duroy’s scrappy manner of social climbing is fascinating in that it is largely controlled by others when he thinks he’s in control – he is at least partially a monster made by others who then takes them all by surprise. And they can all ruefully acknowledge the triumph of the one they underestimated. He is, as Madeleine describes, a bit of a desperate animal, and yet he maintains some inexplicable code of honor by not deflowering Suzanne despite her attempts and showing constant true affection to Clotilde. And after his unsympathetic rant about his need to be financially comfortable overriding his need for love, the writer cleverly saves the reveal of Georges’ parents for the end, showing us just how humble his origins are and what shaped his priorities into what they are.

Madeleine, cold and ruthless though she may be, is in the frustrating trap of being bound to be no better than the man she controls like a puppeteer with a faulty marionette. The remaining characters are deliciously dimensional as well. The script is well written and has just enough plot to keep it from wallowing in the personal hells of the characters, but it is extremely cynical and has a twisted perversion of a happy ending. There is no attempt at social or moral responsibility, which is both refreshing and depressing. Although it ends somewhat bitterly, with Georges’ transformation making him fit for surviving his world but essentially heartless, the ride along the way makes this script a CONSIDER.

SYNOPSIS
1890s Paris – Young handsome GEORGES DUROY is broke but yearns for the good life. His luck changes when he goes to the Gavotte nightclub and runs into former comrade-at-arms CHARLES FORESTIER, whom he fought with in Algeria. Charles, now a rich political editor at the Parisian, gives Georges some money to get a suit for dinner the next night. Georges uses some of the money on prostitute RACHEL. At dinner, he meets and charms Charles’ beautiful frosty wife MADELEINE, gorgeous warm (and married) CLOTILDE, and lovely Madame ROUSSET (wife of Mr. ROUSSET, editor-in-chief of the Parisian). The women convince Mr. Rousset to offer Georges a writing assignment about his war experience. Next day, Madeleine “helps” him write it, dictating to him. She advises him to seek Mme Rousset’s approval due to her influence over her husband, and turn to Clotilde for “company”. Then the older COMTE de Vaudrec arrives and Madeleine hurriedly shows a suspicious Georges out. 

The article is a success but Georges, in the packed journalists’ room at the Parisian, is unable to write another. He invites Clotilde to his shabby flat where they make love, and she proposes setting up a nicer flat, a “love nest” for their trysts. For a while they enjoy one another until Rachel the prostitute approaches Georges at the Gavotte in front of a hurt and embarrassed Clotilde. Georges tries to get another assignment at the Parisian but Charles dismisses him, saying his wife won’t write any more of Georges’ articles. So Georges visits Mme Rousset and charms her and her friends. Next day, he’s reinstated as Head of Gossip at the Parisian. Charles becomes ill and goes to Cannes with Madeleine for his health. Georges is their only visitor, attending to Madeleine who attends to Charles. When Charles dies, Georges tells Madeleine honestly that his heart belongs to her and he will be her friend or husband as she sees fit. She is touched, but counters that she insists on her freedom even when married and he should re-consider his proposal. Enamored, Georges regretfully informs a sad but understanding Clotilde that he will be marrying Madeleine.

Madeleine changes his name to Georges du Roy de Cantel, he is promoted to Charles’ old position as political editor, and his new wife dictates all his articles to him. She invites Rousset and LAROCHE the politician to dine, and they discuss the government’s corrupt intentions towards Morocco and how to expose it via Georges’ articles (which everyone knows Madeleine will write). The Comte de Vautrec continues to visit Madeleine every Tuesday and Georges tries to convince himself it’s platonic. Madeleine throws herself into research for Georges’ article, rebuffing his tender advances and perfunctorily having sex so that he’ll get back to writing. The expository article is a success: the Parisian holds a party in which Laroche is hailed as the new foreign minister and the Roussets’ daughter SUZANNE makes eyes at Georges, calling him “Bel Ami” as she hears the older women referring to him. Clotilde is genuinely happy for Georges. Rousset boasts that his paper can overturn governments, and Georges slyly mentions it may be his words and not Rousset’s paper. Rousset casually mentions the Comte pays for Georges’ and Madeleine’s apartment and did the same for Charles, who also rode Madeleine’s words to success. A hurt and disillusioned Georges resumes his affair with Clotilde. 

He also notices Mme Rousset’s adoring but bashful attentions. She’s never had an affair, but he seduces her in Clotilde’s love nest and she quickly falls in love with him. The Comte passes away and leaves Madeleine as the sole inheritor of a large sum. Part of Georges wants to reject the money of her lover, but he rationalizes that by accepting it he might stomp rumors out instead. A grieving Madeleine is disgusted by his greed and Georges painfully realizes that the Comte was her only true love. Clingy Mme Rousset tries to tempt a distraught Georges to see her by giving him information: Laroche and Mr. Rousset, contrary to their outwardly friendly approach to Morocco, have been plotting and stand to make a fortune by taking Morocco economically. Infuriated that he was left out of the plan, he thrusts Mme Rousset away. He finds comfort in Clotilde’s arms until she finds one of Mme Rousset’s red hairs and is horrified he shared their love nest with another. After Clotilde casts him out, Rousset and Laroche kick him out of the Parisian (with a regretful apology to Madeleine). Madeleine contemptuously accuses Georges of being an empty vessel in which she tried to pour her talent, an animal she tried to teach rather than train. After hitting rock bottom, George reflects and rallies himself.

He attends Rousset’s party at a new palatial home after the taking of Morocco where he is mostly shunned (particularly by Madeleine who attends with Laroche) and makes sincere amends with Clotilde, the one person to whom he can confide. Then he catches the eye of Rousset’s daughter Suzanne, surrounded by suitors due to her now enormous dowry. Georges acts quickly: he brings the police to catch Madeleine and Laroche in bed together and divorces her. He elopes with Suzanne (although he does not sleep with her), then brings her back home to face her wretched mother and angry but grudgingly impressed father. Mr. Rousset tells his wife that her infatuation with Georges infected their daughter and says Suzanne must marry Georges, whom he respects for audacity. To boot, he invites Georges to become editor-in-chief of the Parisian when he retires.

In a last visit to Clotilde, Georges explains he never wanted to hurt her, but her love isn’t enough – she doesn’t know what it’s like to be poor and desperate. At the wedding, attended by his peasant parents and the elite of Parisian society, Georges is relieved and overwhelmed by his achievement when he and Suzanne finally become man and wife. Madeleine, in attendance with a new beau who is “writing” at the Scribe, shakes his hand and they exchange a knowing look of respect. Clotilde, constant as ever, squeezes his hand. Then Georges exits the cathedral with his new bride, where the possibilities of Paris await him.

COMMENTS 
Wow.  This one… is RAW. I really like Paddy Considine; and this seems like a project cut from the cloth of some of Shane Meadows’ more intense stuff, but this project is extremely intense… from the opening scene of Joseph kicking and killing his own dog, until the harrowing climactic fights, this is completely no holds barred, shocking in its brutality… and quite hard to read; as I’m sure it will be to watch. At its heart, there are two really compelling, troubled characters.  If Considine does a great job, this could be a very intense, talked about film; but its going to alienate broader audiences.  For arthouse I’d say = wait and see.  Pass for popcorn… 
 
SUMMARY 
 JOSEPH is clearly troubled; perhaps crazy.  He comes out of a pub after an argument and kicks his own dog so hard that it dies shortly after. He insults a shop owner and gets banned from the store, so he returns and tosses a brick through the place’s front window.   At a pub he gets into an innocent seeming argument with a few youngsters and winds up beating one of them, TERRY, badly. 
 
Joseph hides in a Christian book shop; the keeper, HANNAH, prays out loud for him and Joseph winds up crying. 
 
The store owner sends some young thugs after Joseph and they beat him badly; bruised and battered he heads to the book shop and insults Hannah. 
 
When she gets home, her husband walks in drunk and pisses all over her (literally). 
 
The next day, Joseph goes back to the bookshop and apologizes to Hannah. They go for a beer.  
 
Joseph asks Hannah to come to the hospital and pray for his dying buddy Jack.  
 
James, Hannah’s husband, questions her; “you were seen with a man.”    Joseph sees her with a black eye and Hannah tells him she got it from falling in the bath.   
 
Jack dies. 
 
Joseph goes to the Christian shop and Hannah helps him pick out a suit; Joseph comes in and aggressively threatens Hannah.  She locks up and starts screaming at her picture of Jesus on the wall. 
 
Hannah gets wasted and returns home and stands up to James for the first time; yelling at him and insulting him. In the morning he retaliates and attacks; raping her and brutally beating her.  
 
Hannah escapes and looks for Joseph, finding him at Jack’s daughter, MARIE’s house. 
 
Hannah joins Joseph at Jack’s funeral and they all go for a drink after; Marie seems to forgive Joseph a bit… she has resented him and seemingly blamed him for her father’s sickness, but she seems to be relenting. 
 
Hannah and Joseph wind up growing close; she stays at his house, hiding from James. She tells him about her revelatory experience that led to her getting invovlved in religion and he tells her about how cruel he was to his deceased wife; that he called her TYRANNASAUR because she was so large; that he “drummed the love out of her.”  Hannah kisses him. 
 
Joseph decides to go “have a speak” with James and is shocked when he gets to hannah’s place to find that James has been stabbed to death.  Joseph confronts her and she flips, trying to kill herself. 
 
A year later, Joseph is in jail; he recounts to her via letter a story about killing the neighbor’s dog and attacking them… they’d let the dog attack their own kid, a young boy named Samuel, whom Joseph was friends with. 
 
Hannah visits Joseph in jail.

A young Jewish woman in Vienna is forced to make remarkable choices for her survival when she is separated from her family and all she knows.  Married to a Nazi officer in the heart of Germany and living in constant fear of discovery, she fights to protect herself and those she loves from the Gestapo and the horrors of the camps.

COMMENTS
Well paced, smoothly flowing narrative with moments of alternating lightness and tension.  Very clear characters, Edith’s resilience and Werner’s complexity are especially appealing, and Edith’s story of survival has a lot to offer that isn’t found in many Holocaust dramas— she is unaware of the true magnitude of the death camps, and her struggle is on a secret personal level from inside the Nazi world.  Consider buying.

SUMMARY
EDITH HAHN is a beautiful young Jewish woman in pre-WWII Vienna.  She and her fiancé JOSEF are celebrating her graduation and impending legal exam as the atmosphere of persecution worsens in Vienna.  She is denied her chance to take the legal exam, and the Jews of Vienna are forced into the ghetto.  EDITH and her mother, KLOTHILDE, are to be shipped off to a work camp on a farm, but she convinces the SS officer to spare her mother from this duty.  The sadistic MAJOR BREMMER oversees the camp, and EDITH tries to keep her head down after watching him shoot one of her friends for the theft of a potato.  However, BREMMER allows EDITH to return to Vienna and relocate to another camp with KLOTHILDE.  On the train back to Vienna, EDITH strips off her yellow star and bluffs her way past a Gestapo officer.  She appeals to JOSEF for help, but he tells her that KLOTHILDE has already been deported.  JOSEF is afraid, and more concerned about maintaining his false identity as a Christian.  Disappointed, EDITH turns to her old friend, a sympathetic blond girl named CHRISTL.  CHRISTL gives EDITH clothes and sends her to FRAU NIEDERALL, a Nazi helping to rescue Jews.  With CHRISTL’s help, EDITH gets new papers, and using CHRISTL’s identity she travels to Munich to start a new life focused on survival.

In Munich, EDITH takes the name “Grete”, and is drawn into a new life as a Red Cross nurse.  She meets a handsome man at an art gallery who pursues her energetically.  His name is WERNER, a painter from Brandenburg, and she reluctantly allows him to court her.  He impulsively asks her to marry him, and resists her refusals until she tells him she is Jewish with false papers.  He walks away, but returns a day later to ask her again.  She accepts.

EDITH moves to Brandenburg with WERNER but finds out that he has a daughter and is in the middle of a pending divorce.  When confronted, WERNER flys into a rage, but quickly settles down.  EDITH meets WERNER’s former wife, Aryan blond ELISABETH.  ELISABETH is immediately suspicious of EDITH and over time tries to find cracks in EDITH’s story.  WERNER and EDITH are married, and EDITH is soon pregnant.  WERNER is furious at first, and again once EDITH bears a girl, ANGELA, but each time he quickly relents.  WERNER is drafted, and after EDITH accompanies him to a nerve-wracking Nazi rally (where she fools MAJOR BREMMER’s scrutiny), WERNER is shipped to the Russian front.

EDITH learns that WERNER has been captured in Russia and MAJOR BREMMER recalls her true identity.  However, the Allies invade and BREMMER is shot by one of his own soldiers.  In post-war Brandenburg she becomes a prominent judge despite being treated as a traitor by many Jewish survivors of the Nazi death camps.  She is also reunited with WERNER.  WERNER cannot cope with his new, more subservient role in the relationship and when he leaves, EDITH and ANGELA flee the Russian administration area of Brandenburg into the British zone and a new life.

COMMENTS
Cute, not earth-shaking. Definitely in the old-world school of comedy: witty but predictable, neither vulgar nor stupid, a fish-out-of-water who masters his new environment and triumphs in the end. Amusing but not terribly fresh, ROCK THE CASBAH is timely and likeable. A war(ish) comedy, not quite as classic as ‘Stripes’ but with a certain timely appeal. I don’t know that Bill Murray can open movies anymore, but this is certainly the kind of humor that he does well. ROCK THE CASBAH is most fairly characterized as similar to ‘The Men Who Stare at Goats’ but less zany. It has an uplifting ending and some surprising moments, but overall, it’s a formulaic comedy that hits its mark without stretching very far. Commercial prospects are good but not great; this isn’t to everyone’s taste. I don’t think ROCK THE CASBAH has the chops to be a hit; audiences’ expectations have changed, and the parameters of comedy have, too. This will tend to tilt toward an older audience, harder to capture, at least in theaters. CONSIDER if you’ve got a dependably strong market for comedies. This one isn’t a sure thing. WEAK CONSIDER.

SUMMARY
OPEN in Afghanistan, where a burkha-clad GIRL hurries into the hills and secretly connects a car battery to a TV so she can watch an Afghan pop music show.

CUT TO San Diego. Eighties rock band manager RICHIE VANCE auditions a blonde named BRITTANY. She’s a terrible singer, but Richie is desperate and agrees to sign her, much to the dismay of his female assistant, RONNIE, 30s. 

That night at a raucous Navy party, Ronnie (wearing leather and a black wig) sings her heart out. A drunk WARRANT OFFICER suggests that Richie take her on a USO tour of Afghanistan ‘ for money! Richie bids his DAUGHTER good-bye.

The flight to Afghanistan is terrifying. Plus Ronnie is pissed because she wants to perform her own music. Hours later, it’s clear they’re in a war zone: burned-out vehicles and heavily armed Afghan troops are everywhere. As they head to their Kabul hotel with their soldier escort, PRIVATE BARNES, Richie sees a young GIRL smuggling flour under her vest: these people are hungry. Their fields are being used to grow opium, a more expensive crop. 

At the hotel, a nervous Ronnie takes a pill and falls asleep. Richie hides his cash and passport inside his shaving cream can and heads down to the bar where he meets NICK and JAKE, two ex-masseuses from South Beach, now ammunition salesmen living the high life. When Richie returns to the room, Ronnie has disappeared: she took her clothes and the shaving cream can. Richie begs Nick and Jake for help finding her.

Nick and Jake get Richie stoned and head out into the night, shooting their way past Afghani checkpoints. Richie is pretty freaked out until they arrive at a very heavily fortified but gorgeous nightclub. Richie is stoned but offers his Swatch watch to a gorgeous American woman, MERCI, a prostitute. The next morning, he awakens in her trailer, tied to the bed. Private Barnes appears (obviously one of her clients) and unties Richie, who stumbles out onto the street, lost. Realizing he’ll need cash for a taxi, he hurries back to Merci’s trailer and grabs a twenty from the foot fetishist next in line. Merci watches him go with a smile.

Richie grabs a cab ride from a disco-loving local named RIZA. He’s now stuck in Kabul with no money, no passport, and no phone. His EX-WIFE refuses to help. He finds a hulking, tattooed man known as BOMBAY BRIAN in his room, who confirms that he put Ronnie on a plane to Dubai; she was sick of never getting to sing her own songs. Learning it will take two weeks to 
get a passport, Richie shares a drink in the bar with Riza, while the TV above plays the ‘Afghan Star’ TV show. They’re interrupted by Jake and Nick, who take Richie to their warehouse filled with ammo and cash and drop several thousand dollars in his lap. They have to leave town for a day or two but need a favor: they’ll pay Richie to deliver something. A single day’s work ‘ and safe. Richie agrees.

CUT TO a raging gun battle with Bombay Brian at the wheel and Riza following behind. Afghans in Toyota pickups shoot at them until finally Brian fires an RPG and blows one up. The others drive away. Richie is shaken. Suddenly, he is surrounded by TRIBESMEN on horseback. These are the men to whom he’s supposed to deliver the ammo. Their leader, 

TARIQ, invites Richie back to his home for tea and dinner. After the sumptuous feast, Richie jams on the local instruments with the village men. Richie thanks his host, Tariq. Riza points to the hungry children and women in the shadows. CUT TO Richie and Riza distributing the food to the villagers. Tariq explains that his people long for peace but are surrounded by enemies and cannot afford it. They sell everything they have for bullets and guns. He gives Richie a small bag of jewelry as payment.

In the morning, Richie heads out to take a leak and overhears the Girl singing. Her voice is beautiful; he is deeply moved. Richie spies the magazines she has hidden in the cave and sees the ‘Afghan Star’ contestants on the cover. He races to Riza with his idea! Riza tells him Pushtun girls are forbidden to sing; she will be killed, and so will they. Richie tries to persuade the Village ELDERS to what Riza considers his ‘very bad idea’. The Girl, SALIMA, is Tariq’s daughter. Tariq starts screaming at Richie for insulting his family. Richie takes that as a ‘no’.

Riza and Richie drive away and discover Salima in the trunk! She insists on singing in Kabul, and if a fatwa is issued and she is killed ‘ so be it. That is Allah’s will. Richie asks Merci to keep the girl overnight, but Merci has no interest in nannying. Richie offers to make her a partner, and once she hears Salima sing, she agrees. She closes her one-woman brothel.

CUT TO Jake and Nick playing golf with Warlord AZAM. The Afghans accuse Jake and Nick of selling them useless ammo. One of the men, NIZAR, is Tariq’s brother who wants to lead the Pushtun. Jake and Nick say it was Richie who sold them the bad ammo; they are taken away to have their pinkies chopped off. Nizar and Azam agree to find and kill this other American. 

Richie and Salima arrive at the production studio in Kabul, where Richie must persuade the PRODUCER to bend the rules and allow Salima to sing even though it’s already the third round. He refuses until he hears her sing. Merci gives Salima a tasteful makeover and, despite a last-minute death threat, Salima takes the stage. She sings Cat Stevens beautifully. Tariq catches sight of her on a TV in town. Torn by love and duty, he staggers away into the night.

Richie returns to the warehouse (now emptied of cash), where bandaged and paranoid Jake and 
Nick give him his new passport. The Producer calls; religious ELDERS have insisted Salima be banned from the show, or else the show will be closed down. It’s over. Salima thanks him for giving her that one opportunity. Richie sadly lets her go.

Merci and Richie go for a walk. He admits that he’s leaving in the morning. But Merci gives him an idea: what if Salima still wins the entire contest’ What if the whole country votes for her’ Richie begs the Producer not to pull Salima’s name until after the votes are counted.

Richie gathers twenty STREET ORPHANS where he gives each one a cell phone and a box of SIM cards to vote for Salima. And so begins the promotional push: Riza grabs a megaphone 
and drives around town in his cab. Hundreds of street kids rush out with flyers and tack them up all over Kabul. A MULLAH sees one and tears it down, disapproving. He places a call to the show’s Producer, who pretends he’s gone home sick. CUT TO Azam and Nazir in a limo outside Merci’s trailer; she’s not there. Azam leaves a note. 

Richie and Merci join the street kids in the hotel bar. Salima herself is in her secret cave when her father smashes her tiny TV. CUT TO the show, where the Producer announces that Salima has won the public’s vote in ‘Afghan Star’!

Merci finds Azam’s note. She changes into her hooker garb and hurries out to the limo. Hours later, she calls Richie to tell him what she learned in the hot tub: Azam and Nazir are going to attack Salima and Tariq’s village that night ‘ and Tariq doesn’t know the bullets Richie sold him are useless! He has to do something! Richie takes stock of his life and orders Riza and Brian to Salima’s village. There, Tariq is furious. Richie tells Tariq that Warlord Azam is on his way to kill him ‘ and he is defenseless. Bombay Brian unloads live ammo to the Pushtun fighters.

As Richie and Bombay Brian wait for Azam’s Humvees and pickups, Brian admits that Jake and Nick paid him to take Ronnie to Dubai. They targeted him as the guy to deliver the dud ammo to Tariq. Richie returns the bag of jewels to Tariq ‘for not killing me’. When Richie sees the dust clouds indicating the approach of Nazir and Azam, he decides to try to make a deal. He leads the other three men into the valley to confront the warlord. A gun battle breaks out (Richie catches a bullet in the shoulder) but with their leader dead, Azam’s forces quickly surrender. DISSOLVE TO the big ballroom hosting ‘Afghan Star’. Salima’s about to go onstage. She gives Richie a hug and emerges onstage to sing. The audience goes wild. All over Afghanistan ‘ even in her tiny village ‘ people watch her image on flickering TVs. She sings, ‘Peace Train’.

A brother is sent to fight in Afghanistan while his black sheep brother becomes caretaker to his wife and child.

COMMENTS

This script is powerful, definitely geared for awards season, and has two roles (the “brothers”) that have potential for meaty roles.  SAM’s fall from grace, traumatic experiences and terrible readjustment to domestic life ring true, especially in light of current circumstances.  Tommy’s cynical outlook on life and struggle with alcoholism is a bit thinner, and his quick turn around and redemption, coupled with the love story between himself and Grace seems a bit contrived. The script is well written and packed with emotional moments, but in the wake of so many projects about the war in Iraq, I don’t see it standing out…  An A list cast will help, as will the direction of Jim Sheridan, but there’s something about this project that left me disappointed. 


SUMMARY 

SAM is a career soldier who specializes in leadership roles and training.  As he prepares his platoon for a tour in Afghanistan, he struggles to prepare the young, green recruits for the nightmare that lies ahead of them. 

A week before Sam's scheduled deployment, his younger brother TOMMY gets released from prison.  Sam welcomes his brother, picking him up from jail and bringing him home, but the two quickly get into a fight when Sam suggests that Tommy seek out the victim he injured and apologize to her.  Tommy gets out of the car and storms away.   Tommy later arrives for dinner at his parent's (HANK and ELISE) house.   Sam's wife GRACE and their two young daughters are uncomfortable around Tommy, the two young girls hardly remember him. Hank is less than thrilled at his prodigal son's return.

SAM ships out to Afghanistan and is sent on a mission to find a missing soldier JOE WILLIS, who is a possible P.O.W.   Sam's blackhawk helicopter is shot down, and everyone inside is presumed dead.  Two soldiers come to Grace's house and reluctantly pass along the bad news.   Grace tells Tommy, who's been on a drunken bender since he got out of prison that his brother is dead, and Tommy storms away, confused and upset.  

Tommy and his father HANK get into a fight at Sam's funeral, and Sam senses that Hank prefers he had died. Tommy's drunken bender continues, and Grace is less than pleased when she gets called to pick him up at a bar at three in the morning on the night of Sam's funeral. 

Meanwhile, in Afghanistan, Sam is alive and being held in a cell along with Joe Willis, a cowardly private who wimpers and cowers in the corner of the cell, convinced his doomed, lying in his own piss and shit.  Sam encourages the young man to buck up and promises that they'll make it out alive.

Tommy tries to mend his ways, and enlists the help of some of his drinking buddies to remodel Grace's kitchen.  Tommy goes to the bank that he (presumably) robbed and apologizes to his victim, who is overjoyed with relief, and starts crying in the bank.

On Grace's birthday, Tom buys her a beautiful bike and the two wind up kissing.  Wracked with guilt, they keep their distance from each other for awhile, but its clear that their feelings for each other are growing.  

In Afghanistan, the Taliban fighters increase their abuse of Joe and Sam.  Sam manages to save Joe's life at one point by sharing instructions on how to fire a rocket launcher, but finally caves in when the Taliban forces him to choose between beating Joe with a lead pipe and getting killed.  While the Taliban fighters videotape him, Sam beats Joe savagely (and possibly to death). Days later, US forces raid the makeshift prison and liberate Sam.  He lies and tells them that there was no sign of any other prisoner.  Sam returns to a hero's welcome, but his eyes are dull, betraying the profound change within him.

At home, his family barely recognizes the gaunt, haunted soul that swills whiskey at the kitchen table.  He's tempermental and violent, and his wife and daughters are afraid of him.  Sam senses that Grace and Tommy have grown close and accuses them of fucking each other.   When Grace admits that she kissed Tommy, Sam nearly chokes her to death. 

Sam goes to visit CASSIE WILLIS, Joe's wife, and lies to her, planting a seed of hope that Joe may return.   

Sam's young girls admit that they don't like dad, and wish that Tommy could be there new dad.  One night, Sam flies off the handle and destroys the remodeled kitchen with his bare hands, threatening to killl Grace.  Grace calls Tommy  and begs him to come over, but when Tommy and Sam get into a brutal fist fight, she is forced to call the cops.  Sam begs the cops to shoot him, but Tommy manages to calm him down. 

Sam goes to jail.  Grace comes to visit and begs him to tell her what happened in Afghanistan.  He begins to reveal his secret.

COMMENTS
This is dark stuff, very small and British, reminds me of DEAD MAN’S SHOES, the Shane Meadows film.  It’s a powerful script and I like the style, the brashness and bluntness of it… it’s the type of film my film school buddies and I would be into, but there’s no way my girlfriend would ever watch it.  The plot is thin, but the writing was strong.  I particularly liked the torturous use of perspective, the tension is heightened greatly by the manipulation of space within the house… the film is bloody and brutal but most of the most gruesome events (the rape, the fingers getting chopped, the death of Rian) largely happen off screen, to great effect.  A haunting read.  Not typical prebuy stuff, but interesting project.  I don’t like the title itself, especially as they say the address later and its not even on Cherry Tree Lane… 

SUMMARY 
MIKE and his wife CHRISTINE have a tense dinner; she discusses her day, mentioning a stressful situation at work.  She is leaving her current firm and seems to have slept with one of her former clients, a topic which Mike refers to ruefully.  “I wish I’d never told you,” she laments.  During dinner the doorbell rings a few times and they assume it is visitors for their son SEBASTIEN.  The second time the doorbell rings, young thugs break in and hold a lockknife to Christine’s throat. 

The thugs make it clear that they have come to hurt SEBASTIAN. They tie up Christine and Mike and rummage around in the kitchen for food while they wait for Sebastian to return from a soccer game.  Christine screams when the lead thug RIAN says he’s going to slit “Sebbie’s throat.”

The youths, TEDDY, RIAN, and ASAD, make themselves at home.  ASAD rummages through the dvds.  TEDDY heads up to Sebastian’s room where he chats on the cell with his girlfriend… “no, I’m not with Rian.”  TEDDY finds weed and brings it downstairs and shares it with the others. 

RIAN reveals that he is there to hurt Sebastian as a payback for Sebastian turning Rian’s cousin in to the cops.  Rian steals Mike’s credit cards and sends Teddy to an ATM to take out as much money as possible.  Rian meanwhile begins sadistically flirting with CHRISTINE, “you look fit” and takes her off into another room, out of sight of MIKE, who panics and tries to escape, to no avail. 

RIAN rapes CHRISTINE in the dining room while ASAD tries to make MIKE, now bloody and completely broken down, feel better.  “Don’t think about that, man.” 

The doorbell rings and RIAN and ASAD panic, assuming that Sebastian has returned early.  RIAN tells ASAD he’s got to stab SEBASTIAN.  The door opens and Rian starts laughing; its his girlfriends BETH and CHARMAN and their little brother OSCAR.  Rian told them to bring over an axe, and he was “punking” ASAD by pretending to panic.  The girls come in and hang out, making ASAD uncomfortable.  

BETH finds out that RIAN has been fucking (raping) CHRISTINE.  BETH throws a glass of champagne in his face and RIAN reacts by punching her.  A second later the doorbell rings.  It’s Sebastian.  “Oi, Mom, Dad, why’ve you locked the door?” 

RIAN opens the door and immediately attacks SEBASTIAN; the boys all join in and beat Sebastian mercilessly and bring him upstairs, leaving MIKE alone.  MIKE gets free of his binds and immediately rushes to find CHRISTINE… for a moment he thinks she is dead, but she is just naked and shaking on the floor, terrorized.  MIKE grabs a candlestick and heads upstairs.  He bursts into the room and beats ASAD, TEDDY and one of the girls; they all manage to run away, but MIKE catches RIAN and beats him to death.  Mike screams when he sees Sebastian’s bloody, mangled body.  SEBASTIAN is alive, but his face is beaten badly and his fingers have been cut off.  

Mike calls an ambulance.  He finds young OSCAR standing in the kitchen.

TITLE: Brutal Language of Love
DIRECTOR: Dover Kosashvili
WRITER: Alicia Erian
CAST: TBA
STATUS: Preproduction
GENRE: Drama
READER: Mirjam Wertheim

COMMENTS

Very well written, with good characters, but has the potential of being too slow.  There is a bunch of corny humor, and the movie within a movie had strange porn undertones.  The director made LATE MARRIAGE which was well received, and was in CANNES 2001 Un Certain Regard, but didn’t do much biz.  I think this project is too small. 

SUMMARY 

Penny Karkos, an arthouse movie projectionist, is stuck in an on again, off again, sexually adventurous relationship with her coworker FRITZ.  When Penny finds a lump in her breast and fears it is breast cancer, their temporary breakup is ended by Fritz’s concern for her health.  

Penny also has a complicated relationship with her father, an immigrant who has very particular ideas of how Penny should run her life.  While he cares for his daughter, he refuses to pay for a biopsy of the lump, instead seeing this as a chance to make her learn self reliance.  

The final piece of the puzzle is the student filmmaker LEONARD who makes Penny the focus of his documentary on film projectionists.  Upon meeting and talking to Penny, he changes the subject of his project and goes to questionable lengths to make his film and show Penny he cares for her.  

Spurred by her health crisis, Penny uses the two men in her life as a means to sort out her relationship with her father.

COMMENTS: 
A feel good story, but nothing we haven’t seen before.  Feels like a made-for-TV movie.  The charming and witty young boy, who plays an angel, is the only redeeming ingredient.  The other characters lack a bit of substance, and the story feels unoriginal.  It has little theatrical potential.  I wouldn’t recommend as a pre-buy, see something first.

SUMMARY: 
After several attempts, ZOOEY and ALEC can’t seem to get pregnant.  Zooey wants to consider artificial insemination, but the cost involved is too risky, as Alec is close to losing the toy business his father built many years before him.  Zooey decides that the best alternative is adoption.  They visit a foster home to discuss the possibilities with the director, and fill out the paperwork with the understanding that it will take some time, as the adoption process is lengthy.  

Meanwhile, we are introduced to ELI (10), an extremely intelligent and witty boy, wise beyond his years.  He’s dressed in a suit and tie, always.  He’s not an obvious fit for a foster home, but nevertheless, is very keen on finding the right foster parents.  

Alec struggles to keep the toy company afloat.  He can no longer pay his expenses, or his employees.  Distributors are refusing to stock his product, and the recession has forced them to take a huge hit.  His options are to sell the family business or let it crumble.  Things at home aren’t well either.  Zoey and Alec aren’t getting along as well as they used to, and the locked bedroom door in their house makes it apparent that they’ve recently lost a child.

Eli shows up at their doorstep one day, adoption papers in hand.  The parents are shocked that it has only taken a few days for them to be approved.  Eli makes himself right at home.  Zooey calls the adoption center to check into the matter, and confirm if this adoption is legit.  The director at the clinic had an accident however, and can’t confirm the details since she’s in the hospital.  So, Zooey, Alec and Eli start to build the family bond.

At first, Alec is somewhat reluctant towards Eli, and slightly annoyed.  Eli comes off as a bit of a smart ass, which amuses Zooey but Alec not so much.  But eventually, Eli grows on both of them.  Eli cooks breakfast for them, and takes care of them in a lot of ways.  It’s quite a strange relationship that have with the young boy.  They don’t exactly feel like parents, but are enjoying the company, so they go with it.  

Alec takes Eli to his toy shop to show him around.  It’s clear that this is Alec’s true love, and he’s afraid to lose it.  Alec lets Eli pick out any toy he wants, and he takes home a set of Russian dolls.

Eli learns that Alec’s favorite toy is a lego, so Eli gets the idea to take them to Lego Land.  Zooey and Alec think this idea is silly at first, but after being dragged along, you can see they are really enjoying themselves and forgetting their worries.  You finally see a spark between Zooey and Alec rekindles.

Back at the house, Zooey opens up to Eli about how she lost her son.  She finally opens the bedroom door that she has kept locked for some time, and she starts her healing process.

Alec has finally found some inspiration to create a new toy that he hopes will stock the shelves.  It’s a big box with a question mark on it, and the idea is you’re not sure what you’re going to get.  When you open it you get a few different toys, but you never know which ones.  Eli brings his wit and charm to the business presentations with  Alec and helps him sell the product, that ends up saving his family business.  Toy shops and distributors are thrilled with the new product.

The marriage between Alec and Zooey grows strong again.  They reflect on all that Eli has done for them, just when they get a call from the foster clinic.  The director is back on her feet, and calls to tell the couple that she does not have an Eli on record, and never approved for an adoption to move forward.  As it turns out, Eli is an angel, and he came to their need to save their marriage and help them cope with the loss of their son.  
After the phone call, Alec and Zooey look for Eli and all they find is a letter that he has left behind.  In the letter Eli assures them that the pain they are feeling will soon go away, and as a new life goes, another will replace it.  Zooey soon finds out that she’s pregnant.  9 months later she cradles a little baby.  Eli walks down the street in his suit and tie, off to the next family in need of saving…

COMMENTS
Quite a fun read, and I’d recommend at least reading some of it, despite my instinctive feel that it’s not really commercially viable.  Definitely plays like a Sundancey type film; quirky arthouse piece that seems more like a HAPPY TEXAS type quirky flop, than a LITTLE  MISS SUNSHINE type quirky hit.   Still; the story is brisk, there are   about a dozen really funny lines, and the characters are sharp and amusing, if a bit cartoonish.   The story is told from three   perspectives; those of each dying son, and all three are bizarre and amusing.  The resolution is a bit trite and unimaginative, and all in all I don’t think it quite delivered. Still, one of the more enjoyable reads to this point, but nothing spectacular. 

SUMMARY
DUKE WHITE is near suicidal; he tries hanging himself but the tree branch breaks.  He takes a plunge into Niagara falls…

The WHITE boys gather at their father’s funeral; dashing CAL shows up late because of a dalliance with “Candyanna.” Their uncle PAL concludes a eulogy by reading the lyrics of Freebird and closing with “he was the best brother a guy could have.” The White boys admit amongst themselves, “he was the worst father.”  The boys wind up getting into a fight on the altar.

PAL reads DUKE’s will to the boys, divvying up possessions like a silver bar, an elvis jumpsuit and a wedding band. The will ends with a strange and frightening declaration; “Nuts, Cal, Milo – you boys are gonna die and its my fault.”  The will explains that a medical trial Duke signed them up for has weakened their hearts and they’ll likely die of heart attacks shortly; he also took their money from a settlement from the pharma company and blew it at the track; which is why he decided to kill himself.

The boys decide to live their lives to the fullest; NUTS is the first to take stock. He’s been managing his young brother JUICEBOX to be a boxer and follow in Duke & Nuts’ footsteps, but knows that Juice will get killed by TANK BOY, a rival 18 year old fighter. To get his brother out of the fight NUTS must either fight (and surely die) or pay the fight promoter FITZ, 20 grand.  Nuts tries to pay Fitz off with the silver bar, but Fitz beats the crap out of him with a  
cricket bat and demands one of the brothers take part in the fight.   
NUTS decides to step into the ring.

FLASHBACK to earlier; (reprising the same time as NUTS story took place, but from CAL’s perspective).  CAL wakes up next to a waitress and realizes she’s previously slept with Duke; “by the transitive property of penises I just slept with my mother!”  CAL decides its time to stop whoring around and marry his ex MIRANDA, “the one that got away.”

PAL warns CAL not to go after her; she’s been married three times and all three men have died.  CAL ignores him; Miranda is happy to see him, but insists he has to earn her hand; she takes him to a biker bar where he meets her ex lover, BIG MITCH; a huge biker who challenge CAL to a fight; a stick and nail fight. CAL looks doomed but a bar of silver flies from nowhere and knocks Mitch out.  Rather than let CAL go to Miranda, MITCH handcuffs himself to Cal and to a railroad spike; which succeeds in stopping Cal, but also puts them dead in the path of an oncoming train. “I didn’t think that far ahead.”  Cal has to chop Mitch’s hand off.

Cal takes Miranda to Niagara falls and prepares to pop the question; “Miranda, will you…”

FLASHBACK to earlier; from MILO’s viewpoint now; MILO is the most nervous and wound up of the bunch; he quits his job and makes a to do list of things he wants to do before he dies. He dons his Elvis jumpsuit, buys a Torino and asks out a girl he’d been eyeing.  For his grand finale he buys a barrel and plans to ride over Niagara Falls; his brother TODD tells their mother, GOLDIE, who rushes to the falls to stop him. She tells him that he’s not dying; she switched out the pills with tic tacs.  MILO can’t stop the barrel and heads for the lip of the falls…

FLASHBACK – Duke.

DUKE has been pushed to the bottom, crushed by the waves for two weeks; dead. He has an out of body voice over, describing how he saw his three sons in time of crisis: his dead body burst out of the water, interrupting CAL’s proposal to Miranda and saving him from a terrible fate; his body causes an ambulance to veer into a power pole, cutting the power from the boxing ring and saving NUTS’s life, and finally, he manages, through coincidence, to stop Milo from falling over the falls… He sees his family all together; “I was so happy I knew that I must be dead.”",,

A group of college kids have their party weekend disrupted by rampaging sharks who have infested a lake.

COMMENTS
This is a particularly poor piece of popcorn, and there are plenty of better 3D projects on the horizon, I see no reason to jump on this one; the writing is juvenile and predictable and the premise is as thin as Ellis’s SNAKES ON A PLANE. Think: TONS OF SHARKS IN A LAKE. I don’t think the writers ever bothered explaining HOW the dozens of sharks got into the lake, somehow these renegade nature documentarians in search of a payday managed to drum up a multi million dollar budget for their nefarious plan.  There are about ten action scenes that result in people getting eaten by sharks, and one or two fist fights and gun fights thrown in for good measure.  PASS.


SUMMARY
Nubile youngster JESS gets eaten by a shark after horsing around in a lake with her boyfriend. He chases in after her and gets eaten as well.


Cut to: TULANE UNIVERSITY. NFL prospect MALIK scores a B on a crucial test and invites his tutor, NICK (and Nick’s dorky friend GORDON) to red hot 21 year old Sarah Palski’s Lake House, along with her other hot friends MAYA (malik’s gf) and BETH.


On the way to her house they have a run-in with a pair of scary locals; a racist dude RED with pointy teeth, and a tough guy DENNIS, built like a brick, with scars all over his face. DENNIS and MALIK nearly get into a brawl in the parking lot, but Dennis backs down when he recognizes Sarah. He invites her to go diving while she’s at the lake. NICK realizes the pair have a painful (romantic) history.


NICK, MALIK and BLAKE (Malik’s buddy) take a boat out onto the lake and go wake boarding; NICK drives and Malik rides, but MALIK gets into an accident and gets his armed ripped off.  Everyone thinks Nick ran Malik over with the boat, but when Nick heads back into the water to retrieve Malik’s arm he sees an eight foot bull shark. “Don’t go in the water.”


They get in a speed boat to rush Malik to a hospital. Malik, bloodied and crazed, propose marriage to Maya (she says yes!); and moments later she falls overboard and gets eaten by a shark.  The boat is damaged, so they have to turn back and return to the remote cabin; no signal, no phones and now, no boat.


Just when they think they are stranded, RED and DENNIS, the violent locals, stop by (presumably to try to rape Maya). When they find out about the attack they spring into action and promise to help medivac a doctor in; they have an electronic SHARK SHIELD for their boat and insist they’ll be alright crossing the lake to get help.


The group splits up; NICK, BLAKE and SARA stay with the badly injured Malik (who has also just learned his fiancé is dead).  GORDON and BETH go with DENNIS and RED to find help.


NICK and SARA share a romantic moment, but when she realizes he has a crush on her; she tells him he should get over it. She reveals that she had been Dennis’ lover, and accidentally cut his face open with a boat propeller… and never visited him in the hospital. She holds herself responsible and thinks no guy could ever love her.


MALIK snaps and heads into the lake. Using his bloody arm as bait he plans to kill the shark as revenge for Maya’s death “Baltimore rules!”  Nick and Sara try to stop him but Malik finds a shark and kills it with a spear; problem is, it’s a different shark.  Nick finds a videocamera inside the dead shark. “Maybe someone put them here.”


Meanwhile, DENNIS and RED turn on GORDON and BETH; Dennis shoots Gordon in the leg and throws him into the lake where he gets eaten; Dennis is an overzealous photographer hell bent on snapping a pic of the shark and he plans to use Beth as bait. “we’re gonna make you a star.” Beth fights back but gets thrown in and winds up getting eaten as well.


BLAKE realizes MALIK is running out of time and plans to strap him to  
his back and head across the lake on a jet ski. “It’s a dead heat.”   
MALIK’s weight slows the jet ski down too much and a shark starts gaining on them so Malik cuts himself free and slides into the water; towards his demise. BLAKE screams “NO!” but has his own problems – a mako shark nails the jet ski and attacks, eating Blake.


The Sheriff, SABIN shows up, presumably to help – but it turns out he’s in cahoots with RED and DENNIS; they are all putting cameras in  
sharks to film attacks on humans, and plan to sell the footage.   
SABIN drugs Nick and ties him up in a basement with a glass floor that looks into the depths of the lake; there’s a hole in the floor and Sabin threatens to push Nick into the jaws of a tiger shark.


Meanwhile, Sara tries to get the drop on Dennis; playing to his emotions “I loved you!” but he attacks and viciously beats her; “I’m not letting you ruin another pay day!”


Nick gets the upper hand on Sabin by lighting him on fire; he pushes the sadistic sheriff into the lake and closes the hatch; Sabin gets eaten by a shark.


Nick runs to help Sara; DENNIS has poured chum all over her and plans to feed her to a shark; Nick attacks Dennis and the three fall into the water where they are attacked by a great white; the shark kills Dennis but Nick manages to destroy it.  He and Sara make it safely to the shore.

All the while, she is aided by a TALL MAN; a mysterious, evil seeming character who terrifies the town, and who Biel gets in fights with; though we find out later she's seemingly in league with him.  There a bunch of problems, namely, the story makes no sense; the plot is completely haphazard and somewhat insane, and the writing, in general, is poor.  If this is a project that is a driver for a package, I would recommend you be very careful; only buy it for Biel's value, and as a TV or DVD title; I don't see this as having very big theatrical potential.

For middle east it's good genre fun/ action. For others - first time feature director, so likely not a prebuy, but its a fun script, worth a look.

Film is meant to be in the style of John Carpenter, and its a lot of fun; young British gangbangers fighting against invading Aliens; I've read 3/4th of the script and its fun, breezy, it would be fun to watch.

An attractive young woman walks home through dark, dangerous streets in south London. She falls into an ambush. Five ghoulish, hooded youths surround her— they take her mobile, her purse, her engagement ring, but they want more. Just then, a fireball explodes out of the sky and destroys a nearby parked car.
From the wreckage emerges a vicious little alien that the youths hunt down, kill and triumphantly parade back to their block. But their adventure is not over. The night is still young and the attack on the block has only
just begun...

SUMMARY: 
A young woman SAM gets attacked by teen hoodlums, outside her apartment complex in the UK, but the attack is interrupted when a fireball falls from the sky and hits a nearby car. The hoodlums,  led by MOSES, find an alien in the car.  They beat the small but fierce alien to death.  “you killed an alien!” 

The FEDS interview SAM and ask her about the hoodlums. “There were five or six I think…” 

MOSES gets “hired” by HI-HATZ to deal drugs.  MOSES’s pals are all impressed.  Meteors start landing all over, “more of them nasty little gremlins!” It’s a full on Alien invasion and the hoodlums posit that the bigger aliens are coming to rescue/ avenge their predecessor. 

The gang all gear up, making excuses to their parents as to why they have to leave so late. “Back in a bit!” 

The gang find a big, fierce creature in an off license shop (liquor store). They burst out and head for their bikes, but stop when they see a police van coming straight for them.  Moses gets arrested and put in the back of the van along with SAM, who ID’d him. The aliens attack and kill the cops.  

ANDRE, one of the gang, kills an alien and pilots the Police van away from the melee, but crashes it head on into HI HATZ pimped out BMW.  Hi Hatz is furious, and doesn’t believe their excuse about Aliens, until one approaches, menacingly. “Looks like a dog, with… hands!” HI HATZ kills an alien, but not before his buddy gets killed.  The others take off. 

The gang get attacked by the aliens and wind up barricading themselves inside SAM’s apartment, much to her dismay.  She tries to attack them and defend herself, but they insist there are bigger problems tonight. “This is the block. We gotta take care of things our own way.”  An alien tries to burst in and Moses decapitates it with a samurai sword. 

Meanwhile, HI HATZ is still pissed at Moses and his gang, and vows to find them and teach them a lesson. 

MOSES realizes that the aliens seem to be after him; they get in a few more fights before deciding to hide in drug dealer ROY’s weed room which is enforced with steel doors, but HI HATZ sees him and starts chasing and opening fire.  “Is there anyone on this block that doesn’t want to kill you?”

As aliens swarm around, they are forced to climb up the outside of the building from Moses’ place to Roy’s.  HI HATZ was laying in wait, but he gets killed by an alien. The gang and Sam make it into Roy’s safe room. 

The boys win a final showdown against the aliens.  The cops finally arrive and ask Sam to testify against them but she refuses.

COMMENTS

Above average, intelligent horror, not straight popcorn stuff,  a bit more highbrow.  I haven’t seen the Exorcism of Emily Rose, but this seems cut from that same clothe (excuse the pun).  I didn’t like the handheld, home video angle, as that seems to be the go to stylistic choice in horror films these days, but the end sequence has the potential to be quite scary.  Would be better to watch the film, but interesting, also Roth’s name is a good sign, though he’s not directing.

SUMMARY

In 1971, at the age of 8, James “Cotton” Marcus became an evangelical minister.  In 2006, a documentary crew set out to capture his final days on the job. After decades of being a popular man of God, Cotton had long stopped believing in what he was preaching.  No longer interested in “taking advantage of people” and being involved in what he believed was a business of fraud, he was leaving the ministry in order to show his kids the meaning of an honest living.  Cotton Marcus was prepared to denounce God on film. On the crew’s first day, Cotton receives a letter from a poor farmer in Ivanwood, Missouri, who mentions possession and the devil existing on his farm and begs for Cotton’s help.  With an opportunity for the crew to film him at work and a chance to make some money, Cotton agrees to one last exorcism.

The Excorcism proves to be alarming, and Cotton is quickly thrown off his normally smooth, charming ways.  The Alcoholic Farmer OLIVER’s daughter NELL exhibits symptoms that seem inexplicable, and his son TYLER is a skeptic who seems to know COTTON is a fraud. Cotton performs a little mumbo jumbo that tricks Oliver, but is alarmed when he finds Nell in his motel room that night. “Want to make a porno?” When Cotton, Nell and the crew get back to the farmhouse they are alarmed to find TYLER cut and injured badly. OLIVER is upset – “you said the demon was out of her.”  Oliver takes Tyler to a hospital.  While Cotton is watching Nell, she runs off into the woods where Cotton finds her in a transelike state surrounded by strange inscriptions in rock; he is further shocked to find she is pregnant.  Suspicious that the baby is a product of insect, Cotton confronts Oliver, who seems to prompt Nell into claiming that the baby was given to her by the Church. “It doesn’t matter, we’re taking her to the hospital.”  Oliver, gun drawn, refuses to let them leave. Cotton and his film crew’s entire lives are in jeopardy. 

Cotton admits to desperate Nell that he’s a hustler, and claims he cant help her.  Church folk come over, claiming that Tyler called them.  They take over the situation, subduing the murderous Oliver and telling Cotton that Nell is too unstable to move. 

Cotton catches the church elders performing a demonic ceremony in the cave in the woods.  He stops them from killing Nell, but the ordeal leaves him thoroughly convinced of the presence of God and the Devil.  He takes up his father’s congregation, reborn, a new man, a new preacher, a sham no more.

SUMMARY

JAFAAR, a down on his luck fisherman, finds a pig in his net and hopes that his new catch will help him solve some financial woes, including debts around town that have become so drastic, the local shopkeeper is hounding his beleagured wife FATIMA, and the police have become involved, giving Jafar a time limit to repay his debts. 

JAFAAR finds that selling the pig is a troublesome task;  Knowing that no arabs or Israelis will eat the meat, he tries to sell it to a UN ambassador, but the ambassador is appalled and throws him out of the office.

The local barber recommends that Jafaar kill the pig and toss it back in the river, lending Jafaar a rifle to get the job done.  JAFAAR takes the rifle to the boat and misfires, shooting the pig in the foot.  

JAFAAR finds a Jewish woman on the other side of the settlement fence who is interested in buying the pig semen; to fertilize their batch of female pigs.  At first, he can’t successfully masturbate the pig, so he sells her his own sperm and pays off his debts at the local market. 

JAFAAR eventually succeeds in masturbating the pig, and gets paid very well for it, but still faces troubles; (like when a cop inadvertently drinks the pig semen), but eventually the deal dries up when Yelena tells him that the artificial insemination isn’t working and insists that he bring the actual pig to the border; a dangerous proposition for both of them.

JAFAAR takes the pig home, and his wife finds it;  she is devastated and fearful that they will be arrested. The political climate worsens and JAFAAR fears that he is going to be killed as a traitor after hearing that the Israelis use pigs to sniff for bombs. Jafaar yells at Yelena; and seems resigned to his fate.   He is caught by Jihadists and tells them the only reason he had the pig was as a weapon; he planned to use it as a bomb. They seem to believe him and tell him he must go on with his suicide mission.  

The Jihadists give Jafaar explosives for the pig as well as for himself.  Jafaar goes to the border and pleads with Yelena to take the pig but she tells him that the settlement is being evacuated.  The pig breaks free and runs into the settlement; exploding.  Jafaar escapes. He is lauded as a martyr by his fellow Palestinians, and hunted by the Israelis. 

Yelena runs off in search of the pig; chased by her younger brother who uses a pig of her own to hunt Yelena’s smell. Yelena, Fatima, the boy and Jafaar all find each other and run off together; finding a boat and trying to row to safety as the settlement and the city collapse around them.  They make it to a small island where they find the Barber who tells them that it is safe for all of them to return to the settlement and that the Iman has promised not to chase them.

L.A. cracks down on 'pay to audition' scams
A Submarine Entertainment presentation of a Tiny Ponies production. Produced by Kyle Martin, Alicia Van Couvering. Co-producer, Alice Wang. Directed, written by Lena Dunham.
 
With: Lena Dunham, Laurie Simmons, Grace Dunham, Rachel Howe, Merritt Wever, Amy Seimetz, Alex Karpovsky, Jemima Kirke, David Call, Sarah Sophie Flicker, Garland Hunter, Isen Hunter.
 
Winner of the narrative feature prize at the SXSW Film Festival, 'Tiny Furniture' should strike a responsive chord in anyone who remembers -- or is experiencing -- that post-college period in life when you're impatiently eager to invent yourself, yet hesitant to get started. Written and directed by newcomer Lena Dunham, who also plays the lead role, this technically polished indie often feels like a semi-autographical effort by a filmmaker trying to work out issues in her art that she's still confronting in life. But that, too, may help the pic connect with auds during limited theatrical exposure.

Dunham plays Aura, who, having broken up with her b.f. and produced a sparsely viewed YouTube video as well as earned a film studies degree from a Midwestern university, has returned to her family's Tribeca loft. She's determined to emerge from the shadow of her successful artist mother (Laurie Simmons, the filmmaker's real-life mom) and stifle sarcastic criticism from her ultra-ambitious younger sister (Grace Dunham, the filmmaker's real-life sibling) by striking out on her own. Until she can figure out just how to do that, however, she's resigned to moving back into her old room and taking a job as a restaurant hostess.

The wispy plot proceeds at an unhurried pace, as events unfold with a randomness more apparent than real. Indeed, it's easy to overlook until the final credits roll just how firmly Dunham is in command of her material, and how subtly she sustains a palpable sense of narrative momentum even as her low-key dramedy often seems as adrift as the character Dunham plays.

There's a homemovie quality to the pic, and not just because Dunham filmed most of it in her parents' Tribeca apartment. But there's also a solid ring of emotional truth in many scenes, particularly those in which intelligent characters behave childishly -- their spontaneity sometimes laced with cruelty -- and clever turns of phrase are employed as weapons.

Fairly early on, Aura attends a party where she meets Jed (Alex Karpovsky), a passive-aggressive young filmmaker in need of a place to crash while he's in town 'for meetings.' (His calling-card Internet shorts are near-insufferable, which may be Dunham's way of suggesting that, yes, of course, he's bound to strike it big.) That Jed is able to effortlessly charm her is just one telltale sign of her neediness. Another indication: Aura falls for another elusive fellow, restaurant co-worker Keith (David Call), leading to a payoff scene that is at once hilarious and heart-wrenching.

While directing herself in a demanding role, Dunham displays a notable lack of vanity on either side of the camera. Neither model-thin nor obese, she does little to glamorize herself -- even during a fleeting nude scene -- and less to make sure Aura remains consistently likable. The character behaves badly, or at least heedlessly, on more than one occasion, and Dunham deliberately withholds information, leaving it up to the aud to suss out her motivations. We're never told why Aura grows increasingly distant from a formerly close college classmate (Merritt Wever) while at the same time reuniting with a shallow high school friend (played with fearless brio by Jemima Kirke). Perhaps, pic implies, Aura can't always explain her actions, not even to herself.

'Tiny Furniture' boasts a first-rate supporting cast -- Karpovsky and Kirke are standouts -- and nimble HD lensing by Jody Lee Lipes.

COMMENTS

Epic Italian film that could be very nice, but I have my reservations. It covers a long period of time and spends a great deal of energy introducing the characters.  The scrit covers many historical events that we’ve seen before, like World War II and communism in Italy in the post war period, leaving the script feeling dated.   The pacing is slow and sometimes the story is less than gripping, and failed to hold my attention throughout.  I have a feeling that it’s a risky prebuy.

TITLE: BRIDGE TO TEREBITHIA
DIRECTOR: Gabor Csupo

CAST:  
STATUS: Filming January, 2006
GENRE: Children’s/Family

LOGLINE: Two outcast children create a fantasy world to help escape the harsh realities of junior high.

SUMMARY

JESS AARONS home life is less than ideal.  His mother, MRS. AARONS is constantly inundated with his 4 sister’s needs, and his father, MR. AARONS is struggling to support the family by working at Wal Mart.  Jesse is a passionate drawer with a wild imagination, but his father disapproves of his dreaming, calling it impractical. Jess’s youngest sister MAY BELLE idolizes him, but he ignores her.

At school, Jess is tormented by wise guy SCOTT and his sidekick GARY.  Jess’s teacher, MRS. MEYERS welcomes Jess’ new neighbor, LESLIE BURKE to the class.  Leslie is awkward and shy, and in no time her classmates are already picking on her.  At recess, Jesse is about to win the 50-yard dash, when Leslie breaks from the pack, beating him to the finish line.  Jesse is humiliated.  Leslie tries to make small talk with Jess, but he storms off.
 
Back in class, Jesse harbors a crush on MS. EDMUNDS, his music teacher.  Jess is surprised when Leslie submits an essay on SCUBA diving that’s written with the same kind of imagination that he uses to draw.  Leslie rallies to Jess’ defense when Scott and Gary steal some of his drawings, telling him that he’s really talented. On the bus ride home, Jess returns the favor when he helps Leslie escape from JANICE, the school bully. Jess and Leslie get off at the same bus stop, realizing that they’re actually neighbors.  

Jess and Leslie decide to wander off into the woods together.  May Belle tries to follow, but Jess scolds her away.  Jess and Leslie discover a hidden patch of forest. Leslie proposes that they create a make believe world called Terebathia, where they’ll reign as king and queen.  Initially Jess is reluctant, but Leslie encourages him to use his imagination.  Jess and Leslie roam through the woods, pretending to fight monsters and protect magical Terabithian fairies.  Leslie and Jess become fast friends.  Leslie gives Jess a set of paints, while Jess gives Leslie a puppy, who they name PRINCE TERRIEN.

After Janice bullies May Belle at lunch, Jess and Leslie decide to get revenge by writing a fake love letter from WILLARD HUGHES, the most popular boy is school.  Janice gets the letter and approaches Willard, but is humiliated when he rejects her.  Janice becomes withdrawn and depressed.  Jess and Leslie regret what they’ve done.  Leslie speaks to Janice in private and makes peace with her.

In class, Mrs. Edmunds discovers Jess’ drawings and tells him how talented he is.  That weekend, Mrs. Edmunds calls Jess, asking him if he’d like to go to the art museum in the city to see all the paintings.  Jess bails on his plans with Leslie, not even inviting her to come along.  Jess and Mrs. Edmunds have a great time, and he realizes how much bigger the world around him is, but her returns home to terrible news.  Leslie wandered into the woods alone, fell from their rope swing and died. 

Jess becomes convinced that Leslie’s death is all his fault.  If he’d just invited her to the museum, none of this would have happened.  Jess goes into isolation, emotionally numbed.  Janet stops bullying other kids, sitting with Jess on the bus.  For the first time, Mr. Aarons comforts Jess, telling him that he should keep Leslie alive in his heart.  He buys Jess a set of paints, telling him to follow his dreams. Jess invites May Belle into the woods, anointing her as the new queen of Terabithia.  Together they vow to keep Leslie’s world alive.   


COMMENTS

A solid children’s story that manages to balance both imagination and pathos in a responsible way.  Jess and Leslie are believably written as awkward kids struggling to survive through the torments of pre-adolescence, and their friendship is made all the more endearing by their joint-fantasy world.  Because we’ve come to sympathize with the two protagonists throughout their adventures, Leslie’s death is truly heartbreaking.   However, the script takes some inorganic turns.  Jess’ initially understated reaction to Leslie’s death seems odd, along with Mrs. Edmund’s near-disappearance from the storyline after the accident.  Another point of concern is the intense subject matter of children grieving with death, which may be problematic to market amidst the upbeat nature of this genre.  This is a consider with reservations.

COMMENTS:
A subject that to me seems hard for mainstream audiences. A disaster film that feels very Hollywood, overly sentimental and unrealistic. Although the cast is good, the script is too mediocre to attract a cross over arthouse audience but doesn't have the commercial appeal for the masses. For the price they are asking, I wouldn't risk it. 

Jonathan's Comments: 
COMMENTS:  DRIVE is a crime drama.  The story is more cerebral than some of the more action oriented titles in the genre along the lines of HEAT or older films like POINT BLANK.  It follows a solitary, self-sufficient driver in his struggles to extricate himself from a feud with organized crime of which he wants no part.  The script is a well-written, fascinating character study that should see some success both as a theatrical and video release.
UPSIDE:  The protagonist, Driver, is a spectacular character.  His tough veneer is nearly impenetrable, but he reveals just enough of himself to be truly mystifying.  The difficulties brought on by his conflicted feelings for the wife of a recently released prisoner are impeccably constructed.  Supporting characters are fully developed and serve to enrich the main thrust of the plot.
DOWNSIDE:  The downbeat ending may not provide the emotional payoff many viewers would hope for.  While the script includes several fights and car chases, the story is more dependent on personal drama than action set pieces.  The story gives away very little of Driver’s background, and the absence of information about the character may turn off some viewers before the depths of his personality come to the fore.

SYNOPSIS:
OPEN on the English Bennett family getting ready for work and school.  They live in Japan now thanks to dad HENRY’s job.  Henry and his wife MARIA help their sons LUCAS, 9, and THOMAS, 7, get dressed while chatting about their upcoming vacation to Thailand over Christmas break.  It’s clear that everyone needs a break.  CUT TO the family arriving in tropical Thailand, where the calm, blue sea shimmers beyond a row of palm trees.  At first they fear that their reservation was lost, but a MANAGER eager to make amends books them into a bungalow facing the sea.  They’re delighted, and the next morning, the family opens presents (yes, Santa Claus found them in Thailand!).  The resort is lovely, and finally Henry starts to relax.

As the sun sets, the boys swim in the sea, and she waves away her uneasiness. The family celebrates Christmas in the balmy Thai night.  The next morning, the family heads to the pool.  No one notices a fuzzy white foam on the horizon, just above the sea.  Henry tells Maria that he will not get the promotion he expected, but goes to play with the boys while Maria stews.  She starts to read a book and notices an odd tremor.  Suddenly, a roar rises from somewhere deep underground.  People point out toward the sea, and suddenly Maria sees a huge black wave speeding towards her. She calls out to Henry, who grabs Thomas and Simon. Then the wave hits and everything goes black.  Maria gains consciousness in the blinding sun, struggling to breathe.  She swallows mud.  She calls to Lucas, but they can’t reach each other as the water shifts course.  Fearful that passing debris will knock them out and drown them, Maria urges Lucas to a nearby palm tree; they’ll cling to it as the wave reverses its direction and heads back out to sea.

As the water recedes, Maria and Lucas walk inland.  Maria is injured.  Where are Henry and the other two boys?  They rescue a little boy, DANIEL.   Lucas finds a Coke can, and they all quench their thirst a bit.  Maria hides the extent of her injuries from Lucas and insists that they climb up a sturdy tree that will keep them high above the raging water, if it returns.  They stay in the tree for hours. Maria sinks into her fever.   Hours later, the water recedes and the trio is hauled to higher ground by strangers.  They are driven to a hospital.  Maria is nearly unconscious but keeps her wits about her in the loud, overcrowded hospital outpost.  Lucas notices a bulletin board covered with people’s names as people shout and wail in all different languages.  Lucas holds his mother’s hand as she tells a Doctor of her condition (she’s a doctor too and knows that she desperately needs antibiotics).  

Lucas takes in the others in the hospital, most alone, some gagging and vomiting up black mud.  He helps a SWEDE by writing down the names of his lost loved ones, and then goes around asking other patients.  Desperate victims give him names and numbers, and he writes them all down.  He finds the Swede’s SON and watches as they reunite in a loving embrace. Later, Lucas again finds the bulletin board listing people’s names but discovers Maria’s name is now listed under “Deceased”. He walks, dazed, toward the morgue but is intercepted by WALLACE, the Scottish Grandfather, who promises to help him. 

Wallace records Lucas’s name and the resort where he was staying when the tsunami hit.  Lucas sees little Daniel reunited with his father and is moved.  Then he sees an EMPLOYEE in a Resort uniform that looks familiar and rushes to him; the Employee has a list in his hand, and Lucas recognizes his father’s handwriting.

CUT TO the Resort where the Bennetts were staying.  Now its lawns are covered with debris and mud.  Henry and the boys are sheltered inside the ruins of the Resort as others are being 
evacuated by helicopter to higher ground.  Henry decides to go look for Lucas and Maria and leaves the younger boys in the hands of other tourists, who are all loaded into a truck driving them further inland.  Henry searches for his wife and son deep into the night, finding snakes and corpses but no clue to where Lucas and Maria might be.  When he accidentally dislodges a chuck of cement onto himself, he loses consciousness.

CUT TO Thomas and Simon in a makeshift camping area in the mountains. Safe but scared.

Henry awakens in the bus station, where his injury is bandaged.  He tries to call family in England but learns that Maria has not contacted home.  He breaks down in tears.  Later, he arranges a ride to the nearest hospital, and arrives there just as Lucas waits in line for bottled water.  Father and son miss each other, and it seems they aren’t going to connect as Henry quickly scans the area and then departs.  But at the same time, the mini-bus transporting Simon and Thomas from the mountain stops near the hospital, and little Simon points out the window. “There’s Lucas!” he cries. The three brothers hug and kiss.  CUT TO Henry in the pick up truck.  He realizes it would be smarter to stay in one place, so he returns to the hospital and the mini-bus only to stare in happy shock at the sight of all of his sons.

Inside the hospital, the family gathers at Maria’s bedside.  She has been through surgery and is now groggy, but smiles.  “Take care of the boys,” she tells Henry.  After chatting with her Doctor, Henry tells the boys that their mother is in bad shape and must undergo additional surgery.  Henry tells her that she can’t give up; their new beginning is just ahead.  As her surgery begins, Maria’s family waits, and each deals with the traumatic memory of the black wall of water and debris.  In the final series of images, Maria is pulled underwater as the air is pressed from her lungs.  She is thrown against walls and windows, and finally accepts that she is going to die.  Then she is suddenly, mysteriously, miraculously pushed to the surface.  CUT TO the hospital, where Henry announces that Maria will be okay. The boys leap for joy.

The family heads to the airport, with Maria still on a gurney.  Around them other families hug and cry.  Nurses secure Maria’s gurney for the trip to Singapore. Lucas tells his mother of the good things he did in the hospital, helping other survivors, and she expresses her pride in him.  The plane flies over miles of coastline devastated by the tsunami. Finally safe, Maria and Henry give thanks for being alive, realizing that they were much luckier than so many others.

Rachel White’s life takes an unexpected turn when she wakes up after her 30th birthday party in bed with her best friend’s fiancé.  As the wedding approaches, Rachel comes to realize that maybe it wasn’t a mistake, and maybe she deserves a little happiness for herself.

COMMENTS
A bit long and formulaic, and stuffed with romantic comedy cliché and stereotypical characters—some of which are only present to act as deus ex machinas later in the story.  The character of Darcy, in particular, is written broadly and transparently.  Funny at times, but in general is a contrived and unappealing Cinderella movie.  Pass.

SUMMARY
RACHEL WHITE, a young attorney, celebrates her 30th birthday with her friends at a bar.  Her best friend, DARCY, a pretty blond party girl, takes charge as usual.  ETHAN, an author and childhood friend of RACHEL, tries to avoid CLAIRE’s advances, and DEX, DARCY’s handome fiancé, introduces RACHEL to MARCUS, a scruffy bad-boy.  After the party ends DEX returns to the bar to look for DARCY’s purse.  RACHEL helps him and after having a final drink and reminiscing about their mutual crushes on each other in law school, they make out in the cab and end up sleeping together at RACHEL’s.

The next morning they agree to try and forget it ever happened.  RACHEL helps DARCY with her wedding preparations and it becomes clear how shallow DARCY is and how poorly she treats her friend.  RACHEL flashes back to her days in law school, studying with DEX and then watching DARCY swoop in on him.

The friends have rented a summer weekend house in the Hamptons and head up for the first weekend.  MARCUS hits on RACHEL and DEX sees him kiss her.  RACHEL decides to leave the next morning after hearing DEX and DARCY having loud sex the night before.  DEX drives RACHEL to the bus station and confesses he can’t stop thinking about her.

Back in the city, DARCY continues to exploit RACHEL’s friendship, sending her to choose a band for the wedding reception.  After another weekend at the Hamptons, DEX and RACHEL stay in the city together for the Fourth of July.  DEX confesses his love to RACHEL, but after a confrontation with his dad, a Senator, DEX decides he can’t break off the wedding.

DARCY begins to have her own doubts about the wedding and reveals to RACHEL that she cheated on DEX.  In the Hamptons, RACHEL finally asks DEX to choose her, but he can’t break off the wedding.  Over the next few weeks ETHAN moves to London and RACHEL visits to clear her own head before the wedding.  Deciding that she wants to be a good friend to DARCY, RACHEL returns to find DEX waiting for her.  He has called off the wedding but has to hide in RACHEL’s apartment when DARCY arrives to tell RACHEL her side of the story.  DARCY also reveals that she has been sleeping with MARCUS and is pregnant.  DEX is discovered, RACHEL and DEX’s secret is revealed and DARCY leaves.  The film ends after RACHEL and DARCY run into each other on the street, RACHEL clearly flourishing in her new independent life with DEXTER.

COMMENTS:

Steve's Comments: Filmmakers are trying to reboot the Three Musketeers franchise in the way that Guy Ritchie and Downey Jr did for Sherlock Holmes; but this script doesn't deliver nearly as well.  The writing is often very weak;  the characters are full of quips and witty comebacks but the effect is grating over the course of the entire script.  It definitely reads like a big budget, blockbuster type affair and with the right cast, I think this has the potential to make money in POPCORN territories.  I don't see European audiences watching this;  
and the French will vomit.   The plot spins a bit out of control, but I agree with the reader in so far as; a coherent story doesn't really matter in this as much as the series of action se tpieces crammed in.  This is a piece of business, I didn't enjoy reading. And i LOVE me some good popcorn movies; this one just had the feel of being written by a Hollywood exec. 

Stefan's Comments:  This version of Dumas classic resembles the source material in major plot points only. In this very modern retelling our four heroes have been re-imagined as Special Forces type commandos. They are expert lock pickers, have “prototype scuba gear, and do battle from a commandeered “Airship”.  The pace is quick and the script is not without merit and the major action set pieces are dutifully exciting although not based at all on reality or the time period. That said, the script has no soul. It even “borrows” lines and scenes from other movies. By page 55 I had recognized lines from The Princess Bride, Heat, and the “are you calling my mule an ass” scene from Two Mules for Sister Sara. Since the writer(s) have a whole novel’s worth of source material, including character development and a suspenseful plot, I wonder why they can’t be bothered to write their own one-liners.
This script will never be able to attract the kind of talent to make it play. Pass.


SYNOPSIS:
A map of Europe drawn on parchment reveals the powder keg that is France, with enemies on all sides, war is imminent.  

CUT TO Venice, where several young men silently approach a well-guarded palace.  ATHOS catches anything about to fall, ARAMIS duels groups of men while flirting, and the enormous PORTHOS pretends to be a prisoner chained to a wall.  As they fight, two of the three elicit magical keys, and then all meet up inside an underground vault designed by someone named DA VINCI.  Using the keys, and a combination offered by the beautiful MILADY (Athos’s lover), they unlock the vault and seize a parchment inside upon which is drawn plans for some kind of airship.  They escape using vials of black powder hidden in Milady’s cleavage to explode the vault, which causes torrents of water to drown their pursuers.  

As they celebrate their victory with a typical toast, the three Musketeers collapse; their goblets have been poisoned by Milady, who whispers to Athos that, despite her love for him, “he made me a better offer.”  The offer came from the well-dressed Englishman, BUCKINGHAM, who grabs the stolen parchment and takes off. 

Three years pass.  CUT TO a small town in France, where strapping young lad D’ARTAGNAN says goodbye to his parents.  He takes the family’s tired old horse and head to Paris, where, as the son of a Musketeer, he hopes to join the fighting force.  D’Artagnan proves that he has the swordsmanship when caught making out with a COUNT’s DAUGHTER.  He dispatches the Count’s men and departs for Paris.  Arriving there, a group of soldiers insults his horse, and he demands an apology on her behalf.  He doesn’t know that the man is confronts is the dastardly ROCHEFORT, whose men knock him out.  Before Rochefort can kill him, Milady stops him. Later, D’Artagnan arrives at the Musketeers’ headquarters only to find the gate closed; they have disbanded.  Seeing Rochefort in the street, he chases after him, banging into each of the Musketeers.  Not having the time to duel them there, he arranges to fight them that afternoon behind the Louvre.  

CUT TO the palace, where the power-hungry RICHELIEU resentfully serves the earnest young KING LOUIS.  Milady, it turns out, is Richelieu’s double agent who wants to frame the King’s clever and beautiful young wife, QUEEN ANNE in an affair with Buckingham, hoping to start a war that will provoke a change in his countrymen’s allegiance – to him.

When the disbanded Musketeers – all living sad lives – arrive to kill off this upstart behind the Louvre, D’Artagnan realizes their identities.  They are interrupted by the arrive of Rochefort and forty of his men, and subdue them all.  D’Artagnan himself is drawn to the lovely lady-in-waiting to the Queen, CONSTANCE, who rebuffs him.  Meanwhile, in the palace, Milady sprays some letters with perfume and plants them in the Queen’s drawer, and steals a distinguished diamond necklace.

The Musketeers are called to the palace to be punished for fighting.  On the way, they see an airship overhead.  D’Artagnan is surprised and delighted to see Constance in the palace.  The supposed scolding doesn’t go as Richelieu planned, as King Louis is impressed by their skills and suggests that they be given gold instead.  He also gets flirting tips, as he is a bit nervous talking to his smart and 
beautiful wife.  

The airship, it turns out, brings Buckingham to the palace to meet with his French counterpart, Richelieu.  They hate each other, but believe that they can forge an alliance and avoid an expensive war that neither can win as they fight on other fronts.  Later, Milady reports to Richelieu that the love letters (ostensibly from the Queen’s ex Buckingham) are planted and the diamonds stolen; the necklace is to be planted in the Tower of London as proof of her infidelity.

The letters are discovered, and King Louis is heartbroken.  Richelieu suggests the king throw a ball and so the queen will have to wear the necklace he gave her; if she can’t produce them, it’s certain that she is Buckingham’s lover.  But the Queen finds out that the necklace is gone and confronts Richelieu, who denies knowing what she’s talking about.  The Queen is upset, but revived when Constance suggests that the Musketeers be asked for help.  Constance herself uses her feminine wiles to persuade D’Artagnan to agree to retrieve the necklace from the Tower of London, but the other Musketeers have no interest in risking their lives so D’Artagnan can get laid.  They slowly change their minds, however, after Constance offers to join D’Artagnan on the mission; each Musketeer hopes for career advancement or other personal gain.  Their trusty servant, the old and crotchety PLANCHET, is also dragged into service.

Richelieu blocks all exits from France.  The Musketeers enter a tavern where Porthos sees an old Russian drinking BUDDY; they hope he will get them on a ship heading for England, but Porthos guesses that the Russian will betray them.  A huge fight breaks out in the tavern, but the mighty Musketeers triumph.  They commandeer a carriage, but Constance insists on being a distraction so they can escape.  She and D’Artagnan share a moment; he promises to return.  

Buckingham prepares in the Tower of London.  Milady tells him exactly how the Musketeers will attack, INTERCUT with the Musketeers planning their attack just as Milady describes it.  But then the Musketeers remember Milady’s treachery and decide to change tactics.  Arriving in London, Aramis and Porthos create a distraction while D’Artagnan impersonates a BEEFEATER and penetrates the Tower like a rock-climber, using daggers and ropes.  

Milady, meanwhile, acknowledges that her part in the plot is complete, climbs into a carriage and instructs the DRIVER to take her far away.  She doesn’t see that D’Artagnan is captured and brought to a sneering Buckingham, who is then stunned to discover that he is only a decoy; just outside the window, Buckingham’s airship fires a canon ball at them.  D’Artagnan climbs into it as Buckingham and his men are buried in rubble.  

Inside the carriage, Milady, it turns out, has the diamond necklace; she couldn’t risk the Musketeers finding it.  Suddenly her carriage rises into the air, hooked up to the airship thanks to 
the Driver – who turns out to be Planchet.  Up in the airship, Athos admits that he once loved her
but will now shoot her; to spare him the pain of it, she jumps to her death out the airship.  

The Musketeers are astonished by the sight of a bigger, better armed airship - Richelieu’s!  And it has come to blast them from the sky.  Worse, they have the captured Constance, and Rochefort suggests trading her for the diamonds.  Athos points out that there’s no point to fight for France, since France “can’t keep you warm at night”, only love is worth fighting for.  So D’Artagnan dons the diamonds and walks across a plank extended between the two airships.  

Rochefort deceives them and starts shooting at the other airship.  D’Artagnan is pained at the sight of his friends’ inevitable demise; their airship steers into a fog bank for protection but Rochefort insists they chase it.  D’Artagnan grabs the diamonds, then flees.  When they emerge from the fog, the Musketeers’ airship drops onto Rochefort’s ship, and they both fall and catch on the spire of Notre Dame.  D’Artagnan and Rochefort fight and seem to be well-matched.  They move from the airship to the cathedral roof.  Rochefort has the diamonds and instructs his GUARDS to kill the Musketeers, but the Guards refuse.  Finally D’Artagnan kills Rochefort and gets the diamonds – but how can they return them to Paris within the hour? 

Thanks to Constance’s quick thinking, the Musketeers fly the damaged airship to the center of Paris just as the ball begins.  The Queen appears, wearing the diamonds, much to the King’s relief … and Richelieu’s plan is foiled.  Richelieu suggests that the Musketeers serve him, but they decline the offer as fireworks explode overhead and the Musketeers repeat their famous cheer, “All for one and one for all!” In the final scene, Milady awakens on the deck of a ship, where Buckingham has saved her.  PULL BACK to see a fleet of English ships, all heading for war with France.

In 'Silence d'Amour' (Silence of Love) Claudel chooses a happier theme, a father daughter relationship and his daughter's coming of age.  Together with her coming of age, the father realizes he is falling in love as well.  Apart from the love theme, the film touches on global issues such as politics, love, humor, environment, social involvement and friendships.  The Tarentella, folk songs from Southern Italy, leads you through the film as a red thread.

A troubled married woman falls for a romantic painter who lives across the street, and finds herself torn between a man she adores and one to whom she is hopelessly attracted. 

COMMENTS 
While reading the script I kept wondering why she would take her attraction further with Seth, while she already has a healthy relationship. That the first scene is the same as the last, tells us that these two guys are interchangeable. She would have been happy with either one. There was no reason to go from one to the other. There was nothing fundamentally wrong with her relationship with Lou. 

Geraldine, Lou's alcoholic sister makes it clear to Margot. Geraldine falls off the wagon (starts drinking again) and the two of them have a conversation. Margot:'What happened Geraldine?' Geraldine:'We are both doing the same fucking thing, you know. I do it with alcohol, you do it with love. LIfe has a gap, Margot, it just does.' Basically she is saying: Margot's going away was not the solution. Margot thought that making the right move would take the hole away. But it is obvious that the next person, also comes with minor issues. 

While reading I kept thinking how childish of Margot to take her attraction to Seth to the next step. I thought, wow, this script feels young and depth was lacking. But in the end it is clear that that was her point. Margot was being childish. She is in love with falling in love. 

And that is the story Sarah Polley wants to tell. 

With a good cast and with Sarah Polley directing I would give this a strong recommendation. It will be small, but will have a change to go broader. She did a great job with Away From Her. This has a much younger cast, which makes the audience for the film possibly bigger.


SUMMARY 
MARGOT takes a flight to Cape Bretton. On her layover she claimsn she is a pamphlet writer for the Canadian government and takes a bus ride to LOUISBERG, a colonial recreation town for tourists that has attractions including, “public punishment.”   She meets DANIEL; a playful, friendly guy who encourages her to whip a “criminal” during the public punishment.  Back at the airport, Daniel sees her boarding her flight and is surprised to see her in a wheelchair. 

Daniel sits next to her in the plane and calls her bluff; accusing her of lying about her leg. She admits that she’s got a fear of “connections” between flights; not of flying, but of “being afraid of missing her flight,” and rushing, and everything associated with connecting between two flights. 

The two share a cab home and she’s surprised to find he lives next door; he is surprised when she tells him she’s married. 

Margot is happily married to LOU; a cookbook writer, but she finds herself longing for DANIEL. One morning, the two go out for coffee and he brings her back to his apartment to show her a painting he did of her.  A few days later she sees him at the gym; she’s in the middle of an embarrassing class workout and he makes her laugh so much she has to leave. They go for midday drinks, which they don’t touch, and overtly flirt with each other.

Margot goes to a swimming class in the gym with her sister in law and a friend; and Daniel shows up (because Margot pleaded with him not too) and makes her laugh so hard she winds up peeing in the pool.

COMMENTS

From the opening frames it was clear that this isn’t a project for our clients.  The premise, plot and even dialog had the potential to be very interesting, but the production looks like a poorly done late night cable tv movie.  The CIA agents, terrorists and government figures are played by actors more fit for low budget skin flicks than intelligent espionage thrillers.  Poorly acted, directed and shot, this film winds up being almost so bad it’s worth watching for sheer amusement.   I don’t recommend (not even for TV.)

A man and his girflriend return to his childhood home where she is shocked to learn he has  a deceased twin sister


COMMENTS

Script is built around the main character’s lost sister, the titular KATE, who’s relationship with her twin brother haunts the family.  The script weaves between NED’s reminiscence of his relationship with his sister and the troubled relationships left in the wake of her death; his dying father, and hopeless sister.  The characters seemed real, but the fact that the entire script revolves around such morbid and depressing material put me off a bit;  this is a project that is going to require remarkable, awards worthy performances from relative unknowns in order to draw audiences.  Not a prebuy. 


SUMMARY 

“Oh, My God!  Ned, did you fuck your sister?” Ned (35) is challenged by 
his girlfriend, Toni (21), after she reads his diary. The time is a week before Christmas and Ned and Toni have returned to the isolated homestead of Ned's childhood. Ned has not been back for many years, since his brother's suicide.  Now, with his father, Bruce, on 
his deathbed the time has come to make peace and to make sense of the death of his elder brother. Yet, as Ned's memory is jogged and he begins to recall past events, Toni discovers something far more disturbing beneath Ned's obsession with his past. A sister, Kate. Physically, not so different from Toni herself. Slowly, uncomfortable suspicions about their own relationship take shape and Toni feels compelled to discover the truth. 
What she discovers is enough to send her packing. Ned finds himself alone to face his demons and to nurse his dying father. This is no easy reconciliation.  Ned has blamed his father for his brother's suicide. Bruce, left to bring up three children when his wife died, was strict and autocratic .  His  'soft'  eldest  son became an easy target for  his  frustrations and failures.  Ned, blaming Bruce for Toni's departure as well, delivers his verdict: “You killed him with your poison and you're still at it.” Ned is stuck with his infirm, cantankerous father, but Bruce also has his own questions that he desperately needs answered before he dies.  Why did Ned run away? While Ned denies him answers, Bruce must accept Ned's bitter accusation that he is responsible for his son's death. 
However, Ned's satisfaction proves fleeting. As he reconstructs the last fateful  weeks of  his childhood and the potent  sexual  power  that the beautiful  but disturbed Kate held over both brothers, he finds that his interpretation will not hold.  Is the terrible truth that Ned and his brother were no different from each other? Ned has left his father to die with a burden of guilt he does not deserve, but he knows that the truth will inflict an even greater wound. In a final humane act, Ned reclaims guilt and vindicates his father. Now 
that both are able to offer and receive forgiveness, father and son are reconciled.  Although Bruce dies, Ned, freed from his obsession for his sister, is able to love again.

LOGLINE

1939 is a tense psychological thriller set on the eve of World War II and based on disturbing real events. A highly charged story of a young woman who stumbles across evidence of a sinister Nazi appeasement plot that will stop at nothing to achieve its aims. As close friends die in suspicious circumstances, she finds herself in extreme danger from an increasingly menacing and powerful enemy.

COMMENTS

The story has a very interesting core premise, that ANNE is basically trapped within her own family, buried under lies and charm while people die as the mystery unfolds around her, but I grew weary of the slow story telling.   This is most certainly one to watch rather than prebuy and I don’t think that the script is very well done. There’s a panoply of interesting characters, I particularly liked the malevolent BASCOMBE; and the sequence where ANNE finds LAWRENCE dead is very strong and cinematic, but the peaks were spread too thin over the 140 page script. 

SUMMARY

1939. Great Britain.  Before the Blitz, before the war.  Young daughter of privilege ANNE, a film actress, brings her boyfriend LAWRENCE to dinner at her families estate to celebrate her father ALEXANDER, a member of the parliament’s, birthday.   HECTOR, Lawrence’s friend and a young turk in the Parliament also attends and speaks quite vehemently about his opposition to the Prime Minister’s mollycoddling of HITLER; whom Hector believes to be a burgeoning threat.    Another dinner guest, BALCOMBE, a government agent, takes a negative opinion of HECTOR and seems quite agitated.

ANNE finds some mysterious recordings of confidential government conversations filed away in her father’s garage.  Balcombe had been storing them there secretly. Anne is shocked to find out later that HECTOR is dead; purportedly a suicide, but the feeling is that he may have been killed for his outspoken views. 

During a family picnic, something quite strange happens, ANNE, while in charge of watching a baby OLIVER, falls asleep and wakes to find, in horror, that the baby has gone missing.  She screams in terror, convinced she’s seen a malignant person on the grounds, but the baby turns up, seemingly untouched in her pram, on a pathway.  The family is relieved, but ANNE remains shaken. She is suspicious of Balcombe.

Anne listens to the recordings and hears HECTOR being threatened; “I want you to stop calling my parents, do you hear me???” Anne confides in her actor friend GILBERT, who takes the recordings with a vague promise to listen to them. 

War is declared on Germany. GILBERT gets murdered, again the death dressed up to look like a suicide.  Anne is forced to do ADR work on a scene she’d shot with Gilbert, and hears him seemingly flub a line, “you should listen to it again, Anne.”  She gets the message loud and clear. 

Listening to the recordings again she is devastated to hear that her brother seems to be one of the plotters behind Hector’s death.  Anne tells Lawrence the entire story and he professes to know about it all, insisting that she give him the recordings to give him proof.  Lawrence is killed.  Anne has a fit in public, nearly passing out and is brought home by her father.  She is sedated and put to bed where she is visited by Balcombe, who tells her that the conspiracy is true, that there’s a group trying to stop the war by making a deal with Hitler, and that her father not only knows about it, but chairs the meetings. “The recordings were made for him.” 

Alexander, her brother Ralph and the others hold Anne prisoner but she manages to escape.  Years later, young MICHAEL gets OSCAR (the baby) and young WALTER, both now very old men to tell him the truth and they admit they’d helped the family keep Anne quiet and deceive her.  A very old ANNE confronts them. “we are family after all.”

LOGLINE
In the late 1970’s, life in Belfast is torn apart by political violence and the emerging punk movement.  As young Ireland finds its cultural voice in punk, the man most responsible for the growth of punk, Terri Hooley, struggles to keep his record store in business and his life from falling apart.

COMMENTS
Well-paced and well-written, the characters really come alive through the music and the energy of the performance scenes especially.  The script does a good job of capturing this energy and showing how it drove Irish cultural history through the second half of the 20th century.  The exploration of the deep connection between music and politics is generally engaging, but the story of a man sticking to his rebellious guns and musical mission in the face of enormous obstacles is the true focus of this script.  Worth considering further.

SUMMARY
Young TERRI HOOLEY is taunted about his father, a socialist activist in prewar Belfast.  A gang of kids chase him and throw rocks at him, blinding TERRI in one eye.  We next see TERRI as a 20-year old attending a meeting of  anti-Vietnam War activists.  He seems like a pretty important member of the organization, but is excoriated when the pamphlet he printed is more about himself than the issues.  He leaves the meeting to go downstairs to his DJ gig, where he introduces the dance floor to some Reggae music.  GERRY, the bartender, chides TERRI for working on problems so far away and ignoring those in his own backyard.

Time moves on and we are witness to the bombings and violence in Ireland in the 70’s.  It is clear that the violence is more than TERRI could ever had desired, even in his most vehement activism, and he decides that in a time of chaos the most rebellious thing is to carry on as if nothing changed.

TERRI meets RUTH at his almost-empty DJ gig, and she takes him to a party where TERRI gets in a fight with the bourgeois host.  RUTH leaves with him and a few months later they marry.  They move in together and TERRI gets a visit from his old friend ERIC.  ERIC relates how he was shaken down by one of their old associates in the anti-war movement who is now an IRA thug.  ERIC decides to leave for LONDON while TERRI is determined to stay.  TERRI gets roughed up in the street but manages to escape.  He is inspired by these events to show his defiance by opening a record store, and brokers an uneasy peace between warring factions by giving away albums.

His record store becomes more popular, especially when he starts stocking music for the punks that wander in– music he hears on JOHN PEEL’s radio show.  TERRI becomes an underground hero by telling off some cops at a show, and starts an independent record label called Good Vibrations.  Despite his increasing success, he has trouble making ends meet, as he is not very profit-minded.  He goes to London, and although he recounts his story of punching John Lennon, he fails to get any major labels to distribute his bands until getting a copy of The Undertones’ ‘Teenage Kicks’ to JOHN PEEL.  The Undertones get a huge deal, but TERRI doesn’t push for anything.

Over time, TERRI’s financial negligence takes its toll on his business and his relationship.  RUTH and he have a daughter, but RUTH leaves TERRI when he misses the birth.  TERRI gets beat up by some skinhead punks and decides to have a concert fundraiser at the Ulster Hall to save his record store.  The concert is an enormous success, but TERRI lets too many people in for free to make a profit.  He is acclaimed by the crowd, and years later, after being beat up yet again by skinheads, he is picked up at the hospital by all his old friends from his punk/activism days.

SUMMARY
A bank robber, TERRY, stumbles into a travel agency office and encounters spunky Scottish travel agent MEREDITH.  He buys a 4 country/4 continent air travel pass, and goes to fix himself up in the bathroom, leaving his bag of just-stolen money in MEREDITH’s care.  The police arrive and TERRY escapes from the bathroom window onto his plane, not knowing that MEREDITH hasn’t turned him in, nor has she reported the money.

Arriving in Africa without funds, TERRY recruits a young boy to translate, and robs a bank.  The boy hustles him a bit, but TERRY gets away with some money and goes to Johannesburg to catch a plane to Australia.  Meanwhile, two contract killers, HAL and KYLIE, discover that they have both been assigned to kill TERRY and recover the stolen money.  They’ve encountered each other before, and they engage in a bit of harmless flirting before KYLIE sets HAL up to be arrested.  HAL eventually escapes, and they follow TERRY to Australia separately.

In Australia, TERRY finds that the African currency he stole is nearly worthless so he robs another bank, having to put up with some cantankerous locals in the process.  TERRY gets on a bus and discovers MEREDITH, having used a network of travel agents to keep her informed as to TERRY’s whereabouts.  TERRY is furious at first, thinking she stole his money, but eventually realizes she just wanted some adventure.  They travel together to a Melbourne beach resort.  KYLIE nearly shoots TERRY, but is tranquilized by HAL instead.  HAL takes TERRY off in order to kill him, but has an allergic reaction after eating some of TERRY’s pistachio-flavored ice cream.  TERRY and MEREDITH fly to America, KYLIE and HAL following together.

At the Hilton, KYLIE and HAL wait outside TERRY and MEREDITH’s door speculating whether they have slept together.  They decide to wait to kill the two until morning and go off to bed together.  In the morning, KYLIE and HAL are again about to kill TERRY and MEREDITH, having followed them to a bank, when they see TERRY get grabbed and robbed by a couple of rednecks.  They pick up TERRY and MEREDITH from where they were ditched on the roadside and take them in the desert to shoot them.  However, KYLIE and HAL, perhaps due to their own increasingly emotional attachment, can’t pull the trigger and decide to help TERRY rob a Mexican wrestling promoter instead.

They manage to pull off the robbery, but TERRY gets separated from the other three with half the money.  He ends up in the ring, attacked by a huge luchador, but throws wads of money into the air to create cover and get away.  HAL and KYLIE think that TERRY has betrayed them all, and are driving away about to kill MEREDITH, when they see TERRY running frantically to catch up to them.  After a chase scene, HAL and KYLIE help fake TERRY and MEREDITH’s death, and the two couples split up, TERRY and MEREDITH off to rob banks in Japan, and HAL and KYLIE to recover cash from the rednecks.

An acting coach who has hit hard times finds inspiration from his students while teaching small town community theater.

SM COMMENTS

A cutesy dramatic/ romantic comedy similar to WAITING FOR GUFFMAN without the belly laughs; a saccharine, feel good story tinged with shades of grey.  Script is decent but unremarkable, and the showbiz flavor is clichéd and overwrought. Some quirky small town characters spice up the script, but this is definitely not a prebuy… likely a full pass even if there were intriguing cast.  

SUMMARY

SEYMOUR LANDESMAN, early 50’s, drives a beat up car, wears rumpled clothes, and smokes joints. He visits his father, PAUL in an assisted living complex and asks for money to repair his damaged house. His father turns him down. Seymour is angry, knowing that his father recently gave a brand new car to his caretaker, LUCILLE.

With no means of income, Seymour drives to Rivergrove, a small, run-down city outside of Los Angeles. He takes an offer to  be the new acting teacher at their arts festival. He is enthusiastically welcomed by the stressed out organizer, BELINDA, whose ex-husband DERRICK’s company is sponsoring the event. At the party for the festival, Seymour sees an attractive Russian woman, NONA, who is catering the food. At his first class, Seymour meets his students which include a lady cop, a manager of Albertons, an old man and AMANDA, the angry teenage daughter of Belinda and Derick. The turnout is grim, until Nona shows up. Belinda asks Seymour to put on a production with his students, but he refuses, he will only teach. Seymour works with NONA, who is severely shy, and gets her to open up for the class.  Their relationship (despite NONA being marrid) progresses, and after class one day they make-out. Seymour begins to make breakthroughs with the class. He has them dig into their emotions to act, using his theory that acting is truth mixed with 20% fiction. Soon the class is inspired to put on a production. Seymour tells them he will consider it. After class, Nona and Seymour have sex and he opens up about a woman he dated who has died. He cared for her, but chose not to go to her funeral. Seymour then agrees to have a performance for the festival. The class will do a play about the seasons and each student will perform their own scenes. Seymour’s father comes to visit, brings Lucille, and tells Seymour they are getting married. Seymour is angry and declines the invitation to the wedding. Seymour tells NONA he loves her and asks her to leave her husband. She refuses. 

Belinda informs the class there will be no performance. Derick disapproves of what Amanda is learning in class and decides to cut funding. Seymour visits the board of advisors to protest and in an effort to convince them of the power of acting, he puts the board members through one of his most absurd acting exercises… lying on the floor searching for their inner-child. They are impressed, but it doesn’t change the fact that they no longer have the money in the budget to support the class.  Derick visits Amanda, has a change of heart and decides to personally pay for the show. The class begins rehearsing with new fervor. During practice Seymour using the lines of a play to ask Nona if she will be with him, she agrees. The night before the big event the students thank Seymour for his inspiration but the good will dissipates when Nona’s husband arrives. Nona is torn between the two men, but finally tells Seymour that she must live in reality, not in the world of art and stories. She leaves with her husband. The performance is a success.  Seymour attends his father’s wedding.

LOGLINE

A young man battles crippling anxiety. His psychiatrist convinces him to return to his childhood home to try and uncover the root of his problems. 

COMMENTS


SUMMARY

In slow-mo flashback, JEREMY (then 9 years old) sees his sister AMANDA die in the fertile garden behind their house. Years later, Jeremy has an uncontrollable fear of all things natural, grass, plant life, etc.  He has an anxiety attack and leaves work after a young couple walk into his store carrying a potted house plant.  He gets fired. The only solace he can find when he gets these attacks is to ride the subway.  

His shrink BRENDA suggests that they make a trip back to his childhood home, which he refers to as “Eden.”  Jeremy seems terrified by the idea, but reluctantly agrees. Upon arriving at the train station near his home, Jeremy nearly turns back, “we… we’ll die… it’ll eat us…” Brenda calms him down just as CLIVE, an old family friend and local religious leader comes to pick them up.  Clive, who’s under the assumption that Jeremy and Brenda are married, brings them back to the house, cooks for them and promises to return in a few days with more supplies. Near the house is a church that Jeremy’s father built, “I’ve always felt it was weird, building a church after God had taken away his wife.” That night Jeremy sneaks into her room and watches Brenda sleep. 

Clive drives  them to a foot of a neighboring mountain.  Brenda insists that Jeremy has to “face his fear.” They climb the mountain and at the top, clear a line of trees and look down into a verdant valley, “eden.” Jeremy tries to walk towards a tree, the source of his fears, but as he nears, he starts screaming and hyperventilating, “my feet are burning!” and runs into the safety of the nearby cabin.  Brenda is alarmed, but thinks that his injuries are psychosomatic. “We’re trapped now,” Jeremy insists. “We’re going to die.” 

Jeremy’s symptoms spiral out of control.  “HE makes them scream, they are screaming.” She sedates him and explores the property on her own, finding the cave he used to use as an altar to nature. She rings the bell by the tree house, which upsets him even further.  “I just wish you hadn’t.”

Jeremy reveals that he worshiped nature as a way to cope with his sister’s death. She convinces him to try walking on the grass again, and this time, the therapy seems to be working.  He walks into nature without panicking, and runs off into the woods.  Brenda cant’ keep up.  That night, alone in the cabin, Brenda hallucinates waking up covered in ticks.  She fears that she is suffering from a therapist’s sickness of inheriting the symptoms of her patient. Jeremy returns from the woods and begs to leave, but Brenda feels as if she now needs to fight the fear for her own mental well being.   

Brenda’s “symptoms” begin to get worse.  Jeremy disappears again and she barricades herself in the cabin.  Trying to face her fear, she goes to the cave, where she finds Clive, “haven’t you heard me yelling?” clive has a broken leg.  She goes to the cabin to fetch bangages and when she returns, his leg is fine and his arm is broken.  Brenda, terrified, runs out.  She sees Jeremy ringing the bell to the steeple and beckoning her to come to him. “Come, I want you to meet him.”  Jeremy cuts her clothes off with a knife, baptizes her, mounts her, bites her, kisses her and drives the knife into his own stomach.  “Something must die so that others may live.” 

Clive emerges from the cave holding a 9 year old Jeremy’s hand.  “You can still run.” She stares into the valley and sees millions of dead corpses.

LOGLINE 

After her husband is murdered, a young woman falls deep into denial, eventually seeking out the killer then committing suicide. 

SUMMARY 

	MANFREDI and AGATA are newlyweds living in Italy.  They are poor but they have each other.  They spend their days making love to one another and enjoying life.  They are soul mates.  Agata wants children right away but Manfredi wants to enjoy life alone with his wife a little longer.  For the first time in his life he feels like a man.  She is his everything.  SALVO is a drug addict living nearby, dealing with the pain of withdrawal, trying to quit cold turkey.  Wanting one last hit, Salvo curses and beats his teenage brother - who is only trying to help him - to fetch him more drugs.  After he leaves Salvo takes his hunting rifle from underneath his bed and tries to commit suicide, but he can't reach the trigger with his toe.  He spots Manfredi sunbathing on his porch through the rifle's telescope, envying him, someone who is so clearly at peace with the world.  Then he shoots a cat off the roof.  None of the neighbors hear the shot.
	Agata wants fruit and Mandfredi offers to go into town to get what she likes.  She protests, not wanting him to ever leave her side, not even for the slightest moment.  Agata proclaims that they will be the first couple to spend eternity in each other’s presence.  Having little choice but to listen to his new bride, Manfredi takes a nap, sleeping most of the day while Agata’s mother brings coffee and visits for awhile.  Later in the afternoon Agata yells at Manfredi, feeling that he is testing her by staying in bed all day.  Not wanting to be without his company she yells at him, threatening to call one of his friends to take her to lunch.  She leaves the room but immediately returns, finding a trickle of blood running down his chest.  The police arrive and FILLIPPA – Agata's mother – tells them that Satan himself is responsible for Manfredi’s murder.  Agata is in shock.  She falls completely into denial and spends most of her time talking to Manfredi's ghost, who periodically visits her.    	 
	The police put pressure on Agata, wanting her to remember whom she saw the day of the murder.  She had seen Salvo out of her window but she keeps this from them.  After learning that the killer may only receive a 7 or 8 year prison sentence, Agata is reluctant to tell the inspectors about seeing Salvo.  That is such a short sentence for someone who killed her angel.  Fearing that she is falling deeper into denial, the inspectors reccommend she see a psychologist.  The police eventually show her pictures of suspects, Salvo being one of them.  They put him in a lineup but Agata doesn't finger him as the killer.  She leaves the police station but follows Salvo in a cab, finding his secret bunker hideout near the beach. 
After Agata finds out that she's not pregnant she has no use of the cops' justice.  She goes to the bunker to try and talk to Salvo.  Agata handcuffs him to the bed and promises to do a strip tease for him.  She loses an article of clothing for every murder he confesses to.  Salvo recounts the names of the 9 men that he's killed, telling her that his latest victim - Manfredi - he killed merely because he looked like he was enjoying life too much.  Agata swallows the key to the handcuffs then beats him with a crowbar.  Salvo is able to break free but he falls on his own knife, killing himself.  And wanting to reunite with her lost love, Agata puts on her wedding dress, takes Salvo's rifle and shoots herself straight through the heart.   

COMMENTS

Black Sun fails on almost every level.  First, there're it's main characters.  The writer never gives any depth at all to Manfredi and Agata.  They're totally and completely in love with one another, but never do you get to know how they met, what they do for a living, their hopes, their dreams… nothing.  The character with the slightest hint of depth is Salvo.  He's a drug addict former musician who (and this is never made clear) owes money to the local drug dealers, but his character basically ends there, and for some reason (another aspect of the story which is never made clear) he likes to shoot things from his window with his rifle.  So, being jealous of a complete stranger sunbathing on a nearby porch, Salvo shoots Manfredi???  This is the crux of the story and all it does is open up new problems.  The police don't seem to believe Agata, they think she is hiding something, and they way it's written they'd be right to have their suspicions.  Agata spends the entire second act talking to visions of her dead ex-husband, doesn't want to help out the investigation because she feels the probable prison sentence isn't tough enough, and goes about her day to day life almost as if nothing happened… But in the end this is all just bad writing.  Nearly everything in this script needs to be developed, and as it is now, the story would just be impossible for any audience, much less the adult crowd that this film would be marketed at, to connect with.

TITLE: Ashes to Ashes
DIRECTOR:  Goldie Hawn
WRITER: Goldie Hawn, Jeremy Pikser
CAST: Goldie Hawn, Kurt Russell
STATUS: In Development
GENRE: Comedy
READER: Steven Murphy

LOGLINE

Romantic Comedy about a high powered magazine editor who reluctantly travels to India to scatter her ex husband’s ashes.

COMMENTS

A scatterbrained plot that is riddled with clichés, lame jokes and stereotypes, this is clearly designed to be a comeback vehicle for Goldie (as well as her directorial debut), but despite her considerable charm, I don’t think this is the film that will make audiences fall in love with her again.  Goldie’s character (metaphorically named Baby) goes on a literal and physical journey, but her character is so unlikable at the outset that I didn’t care about her eventual mellowing and spiritual awakening.  The remainder of the cast is divided into two camps, the forgettable (Derek, Baby, Katie, Anne) or the stereotypical (Papu, Papa).  The writers strip mine India for every superficial ounce of culture and mysticism they can garner, but the results are hardly illuminating.

SUMMARY

BABY is a menopausal editor of glamorous fashion/ pop culture rag LADY (think Cosmopolitan) who is frustrated that ANNE BLANK, editor of METROPOLITAN, a rival mag, is younger, hipper and currently more successful as Metropolitan is doing better than Lady with Advertisers and newsstand sales. 

Baby’s assistant KATIE arranges a surprise fiftieth birthday party for Baby, and all NY’s publishing luminaries are there, including Anne, who upsets Baby by flirting with Baby’s college age rocker son DONOVAN.  “You’re flirting with the enemy.” 

Donovan comes to her apartment with the bad news that his father, (her ex) MAX has past away.  At Max’s funeral, Baby is shocked to learn that Max, in his will, asks her to carry his ashes to the top of an Indian mountain they had climbed in the early days of their relationship.  Baby has no intention of going, and Donovan catches her trying to fed-ex the ashes to India.  In order to pacify Donovan, Baby agrees to take the trip to India, but with a secret caveat, she plans to use the trip to create a special edition of LADY that she hopes will revitalize the mag.

Her trip immediately goes awry when she misses a connection flight to Rishikish (her entire staff gets on the plane, leaving Baby behind) stranding her in the Delhi.  In the meantime, her staff parties in their hotel, glad to be rid of their overbearing boss.

A kind man DEREK (whom Baby initially mistakes for a waiter and insults) comes to her aid and offers her a ride to a train station in order to catch a train to her connecting flight.  Derek shows off his beloved India to her along the way, but when he finally drops her off at the station he inadvertently speeds off with her husband’s ashes in the car. She desperately chases after Derek, but loses him.  A young Indian boy named PAPU volunteers to be her guide and helps her find Derek, as well as the bag containing Max’s ashes. “Your little guide took very good care of you.” 

Baby finally starts to loosen up when Derek and several of his loved ones welcome her with open arms at a local festival “celebration of color and light.”

Baby’s bosses are getting upset with their editors seemingly fruitless jaunt to India and demand that the staff return home, threatening to pull the plug on the entire issue.   

Derek and Baby barely make it to the airport in time for her flight, and Derek pulls some strings and gets her onto the plane, but Baby realizes that she’s mistakenly switched her bag and lost the ashes. 

Derek sends Baby a series of photographs of her enjoying herself along the trip and she uses these photos as the basis of her hit edition of the magazine. Max’s ashes are returned to her. Baby quits the magazine and takes a proper trip back to India, releasing her ex’s ashes into the wind.

LOGLINE 

A woman released on house arrest after killing her husband in self-defense learns that her house is possessed by his enraged and violent spirit. 

COMMENTS 

100 Feet is at times a tense, thrillingly violent and scary supernatural thriller.  Marnie wants nothing more than to start her life anew, which the ghost of her husband tries stopping at all costs.  The action lends itself to a tremendous amount of stunning visuals, which if brought to life properly, would keep an audience captivated for the entire length of the film.  But the scripts main flaw lies at the heart of its story.  The writer never explains why Marnie’s husband beat her to the point where she felt she needed to kill him in order to save herself.  Her neighbors shun her and when visited by her own sister, she acts very cold and hostile to her, blaming Marnie for all that has happened.  When you think about spousal abuse, which in a very real way is the crux of the movie, these things just ring false and don’t feel believable.  Marnie at one point also discovers over $1 million dollars in cash stashed in the house.  Her ex was apparently a crooked cop, and Marnie simply has a priest stop by one day so she can donate the money to the church.  Nothing else is ever said of this, and arguably more time could be spent developing the budding romance with Joey, but these story points may be besides the point with a horror flick like this.  The story provides a seemingly endless supply of violent terror. 
SUMMARY 

	 MARNIE 30's, sits handcuffed in the back of a cop car, being driven by Detective SHANKS.  They arrive at her closed up house, meeting a technician there who attaches and explains how her electronic monitoring device operates.  Marnie can't travel further than 100 feet from the unit's power base, and if she does, its alarm will go off and alert the police, and send her back to jail.  Shanks would prefer this, the two of them bickering, Marnie telling him that if he'd only taken her reports of abuse seriously she wouldn't have had to kill her husband, his ex partner, in self defense.   
	Marnie's home hasn't been lived in for 5 years, and currently without any electricity, she does her best to get situated.  She lights candles and spends the night reading a book, the candles at times eerily blowing out and lighting again.  Marnie does her best to tell herself that this didn't happen, and spends the next few days vigorously cleaning her filthy house from top to bottom.  After lunch one day she goes in the bathroom and notices whiskers and shaving cream in the sink that she positively remembers cleaning…  After simply dismissing this second scary oddity, she orders groceries from the market, and flirts with the young good looking delivery guy JOEY.  Later that night she thinks she hears someone walking around her house and calls the cops.  They quickly arrive and search the house but find nothing.  Marnie heads to kitchen to find her fridge has been ransacked, then a HOMELESS MAN bursts out from a closet.  He explains how he's been squatting in her basement, and Marnie, knife in hand, demands he leave.  Then while smoking in bed to try and calm herself, the visage of her dead husband can be seen in the smoke.  Marnie screams and runs out, tripping down her stairs.  She gets to her door but the monitoring device's alarm goes off, forcing her to stay.  Then out of nowhere a malevolent cloud of black air beats her to near unconsciousness.  Marnie is awakened by paramedics and Shanks, who wants to know who beat her up.  Marnie lies, saying that she fell.   
	The next day Marnie learns that she won't be getting her husband’s police officer pension because she was convicted of his murder.  Upset, she starts making coffee, then suddenly every dish she owns come flying out of the cupboards, smashing all around her in a supernatural onslaught.  Not wanting to back down, Marnie lashes out at her husband’s ghost, saying that he deserved to die.  Several days later the Homeless Man returns and enters the house through a basement window.  High as a kite, shiv in hand, he steals whatever he can find then heads to Marnie's bedroom.  He sees her sleeping and approaches her lustfully, and just as he tries to attack her his neck is snapped by the ghost, his body dragged to the cellar.  Oblivious to it all, Marnie doesn't even stir.
	Having gotten to know Joey a little better, Marnie has him bring her some library books about ghosts.  What she reads tells her to rid herself of all the ghost’s possessions.  Marnie packs up all her ex’s clothes and dumps them in the basement, but while she heads back upstairs his ghostly spirit tries to pull her down the stairs.  He then knocks her around, bouncing her off the walls, scaring the living hell out of her.  Having been staking out her house, Shanks knocks on Marnie's door and sees how beaten up she looks.  Shanks searches the house while confronting Marnie, saying that his partner's real killer must be back and slapping her around, demanding that she doesn't turn him in to the cops.  Marnie tries explaining that she's being tortured by her dead husband's ghost.  Shanks doesn't believe her, and thinks she is getting what she deserves by going crazy in the house that she killed her husband in.  
	After several more harrowing supernatural experiences, Marnie calls Joey and he comes over to comfort her.  One thing leads to another and they wind up having sex, the ghost of her ex hovering around the bed preparing to strike.  But for some reason he doesn’t… until the next morning when he strangles the young man to death.  Devastated,   Marnie screams at the house, begging to be left alone.  Shanks then shows up knocking on the door with a warrant for Joey in his hand.  Marnie stuffs his dead body in the houses crawl space between the first and second floor, but the weight is too much and his lifeless body crashes through the floor, landing right on top of Shanks.  Shanks draws his gun, but is attacked by the ghost.  In the confusion it goes off and hits a gas line, setting the house ablaze.  The ghost pummels them both relentlessly, sending them to the cellar where they get trapped.  With the house a full on inferno, Marnie escapes but goes back to save Shanks’ life, the ghost nearly finishing her off in the process.  Then Marnie throws her wedding ring, the last of his possessions, into the mouth of the fire, destroying the ghost.  She makes it out alive, and Shanks, having been shaken and moved by the whole experience, allows her to flee.  He reports to the press that she perished in the fire, and Marnie hops on a bus to start a new life.

WRITER: Jesse Mittelstadt, Story by Alex Merkin
CAST: Mike Vogel (Julian), Brittany Murphy (June)
STATUS: Wrapped
GENRE: Thriller
READER: Joe Rusin

LOGLINE: When Terry learns that his fiancé June has checked into a hotel with another man, he turns violent, checking into the room across from her and calling his best friend Julian to calm him down.  Unfortunately, Julian is the man June is with.

COMMENTS:
This is a tight little thriller script, which has a great deal of tension and utilizes a non-linear form of storytelling to good effect.  The fact that the story jumps time so much doesn’t feel gimmicky as it could, but instead uses it to keep the audience guessing, “How did we get here?” as well as wondering where things are headed.  Using the sleazy hotel as a kind of character as well makes this almost like a haunted house movie—the hotel breaths and roars from its pipes like a monster.  The real test that the film works is that the film contains general surprises, and even the obligatory twist at the end is not entirely foreseeable.  The movie is very small, and the downer ending is somewhat of a turnoff in that it inspires a “that’s it?” reaction, but the journey to get there is well done enough to make this a thrill ride worth taking.  Consider.

SUMMARY:
The Riverview Hotel is a sleazy dive, where a loyal PORTER still tries to hold together the place while catering to mostly trysts and prostitutes.  As the Porter goes about his business, he comes to room 508, completely empty, and then looks across the hall to 507, a crime scene room with broken furniture and blood staining the floor.

Thus begins the story, unfolding in a nonlinear fashion, jumping between scenes.  We begin with JULIAN coming to meet his friend TERRY in room 508, only to find Terry in room 507, the room trashed, a body on the floor, and a man tied to a chair and blindfolded.  Julian can hardly take it, and Terry says he wishes Julian could have gotten there sooner to stop him.

Terry has called Julian because he has found that his fiancé, JUNE, is having an affair in the Riverview room 507.  Terry has checked in across the hall, having borrowed Julian’s pistol.  When he calls Julian, Julian answers on his cell in a bathtub, and tries to talk Terry down.  Only through flashes in time to we discover that Julian is actually in room 507 with June.  He is having an affair with his best friends fiancé!

Back in the “present” where Terry and Julian are trying to decide what to do with the bodies, Terry insists that he should blame the blindfolded man and make him pay.  Julian tries to keep Terry under control, and wants to call the police, but Terry insists that he not.

In flashbacks we see Julian coming out of the bathroom after getting Terry’s call, and he and June working out how he can get out of the room without Terry seeing him.  June slips a note to the Porter when he delivers a bottle of wine with “Help Me” written on it.  The wine is from Terry—a warning that he knows she’s there.   She smashes the bottle, and it cuts Julian’s hands, spilling his blood on the floor.  Using the hotel phone, Julian dials Terry’s number and narrowly escapes without Terry seeing him.  Terry misidentifies another man walking down the hall as June’s lover and knocks him out.

Julian flees to ANNA’s room, an ex-lover of his who he ran into while checking in to meet June (again revealed in flashback).  He pleads to Anna to back him up in his story that he was with her this night, but she is refuse to lie for him, especially when she smells the perfume on him.

Julian goes to leave the hotel, but notices that he has mistakenly taken June’s cell phone, meaning his is still in the room.  Going back up to get it we catch up to the moment we started with him arriving and finding June dead on the floor.  Terry says he has to go get something and leaves Julian in the room alone with the man and the body.  Julian finds his cell phone and notices a missed call from Terry.  In flashback we see Terry pointing Julian’s gun at June and dialing Julian.  When the cell phone in June’s hand rings, he grabs for it and accidentally shoots June, but discovers the Julian’s secret.  Flashing back to Julian alone in the room, Julian checks his voicemail from Terry.  Terry reveals it was all a setup, and now Julian will be blamed for the murder (it’s his gun, his blood on the floor).  The blindfolded man breaks free and attacks him; Julian flees as the police arrive.  Even Anna turns against him, telling the police that he tried to get her to lie for him.  As Julian is taken away, we see Terry disguised as a Bellhop.  The Porter has been helping him all along.  The final image we see is the Porter pushing June’s “Help Me” note into the hotel furnace.

COMMENTS

Barry Munday is a well written, funny romantic comedy whose main character grows throughout the story and winds up changing for the better.  At the beginning of the story Barry only cares about getting laid, whether the women are his age or young teenage girls he meets at the mall.  He doesn't really much care for his job, stays out late drinking, and makes up whatever story he has to just to get into a woman's pants.  But soon after Barry's hospital stay he begins to question the choices he's made in life, and when he learns that he is the father of an unborn child he takes full responsibility for his actions… even though he doesn't remember having sex with Ginger at all.  Barry's character is extremely likable, funny, and his flaws only add to his charm.  All the supporting characters feel like real people and the jokes throughout the script are well spaced and actually funny. 

SM Comments: Funny but over the top – I didn’t love it.

SUMMARY 

	BARRY is a 33 year old skirt chasing insurance salesman.  Whether the women are co-workers, married, or just girls at the bar, Barry is all over them.  But after he picks up a teenage girl at the mall his outlook on life begins to change.  Just as she's about to give him a blow job in a movie theatre the girls father shows up carrying a large brass trumpet.  He swings it down violently into Barry's crotch.  When be finally wakes up in the hospital doctors tell him that the accident has rendered him completely sterile.  Once home his girlfriend LIDA - who has been out of town for a few days - confronts him about his infidelity.  Barry has no excuses and doesn't know what to tell her.     
	The next few days go by in a blur for Barry.  He doesn't hit on any women, barely takes time to check them out, and just feels lethargic.  He gets home one night to find a letter from an attorney claiming that he is the father of GINGER Farley's unborn child.  Barry doesn't remember a woman named Ginger and he calls the lawyer to setup a meeting.  Ginger and Barry meet at 'their bar,' the one they met in the night they had their one night stand.  Ginger dresses horribly, is abrasive, and spends the whole night chastising Barry while demanding that he take responsibility for his actions.  Barry is so overcome with the urge to do the right thing that he signs her paternity forms and decides to be a part of the baby's life, despite the fact that he still doesn't have the slightest clue who Ginger is.  Barry feels that fate has put her in his life and he's going to do everything he can to be a good father.  Ginger is of course shocked.  
	Having wanted to meet Barry for sometime, Ginger brings him to dinner at her parents house.  After her father MR. FARLEY lays down the law how he's to treat his daughter, Barry meets JENNIFER - Ginger's younger beautiful slut of a sister - who spends dinner rubbing her toes up Barry's thigh.  It turns out that Mr. Farley knows LONNIE, Barry's boss, and they decide to get together for lunch early the following week.  Mr. Farley winds up bringing Jennifer to the lunch where she rubs her hand up and down Barry's thigh some more.  Lida spots the two of them sitting together and she comes up to Barry and punches him in the gut, knocking the wind out of him.  Barry is completely humiliated in front of his boss and the father of the woman he impregnated.  
	Out at a strip club to celebrate his buddy DONALD'S victory at the local air guitar competition, Barry spots Jennifer dancing in a school girls uniform.  'Dreamer's' moves are so hot that a customer grabs her ass.  Barry hits him instinctively and a fight breaks out.  Barry and Donald get thrown out of the club.  A few days later at dinner at the Farley's Jennifer speculates about what really happened to Barry's testicles, saying that he was probably injured by a jealous boyfriend or most likely the father of a teenage girl.  Barry blurts out that he saw Jennifer dancing at a strip club, but the family priest who is at dinner says that the whole family was with him that night discussing Ginger's pregnancy… maybe it wasn't her??  Barry is saved from further embarrassment when Ginger's water breaks.   
	After Ginger gives birth to CORNELIA, Jennifer flirts with Barry while her sister lies asleep in her hospital room.  But Barry now knows how to handle her, saying that she is only acting out because she is the family's favorite and she is jealous that Ginger has the life that she really wants.  A few days later while having sex with Ginger - the first time since their one night stand - Barry spots a small tattoo on her hip and then finally remembers having slept with her.  Cornelia really is his daughter and he shouts out her name while they have sex.  
	Barry comes to accept everything in his life, and is now completely happy with his job and his new family.  His mother throws him a surprise birthday party where she gives him a picture of his half-Asian father, whom he never knew.  He'll be sterile for the rest of his life but Barry couldn't be more happy that he impregnated one of the last few women he'd slept with.

They form a close bond, but events spiral out of control and the girl dies.  Blackmailed by an orderly, he must scramble to tie up the loose ends and hide his involvement while maintaining a professional exterior.
 
COMMENTS
 A pretty tight script, it doesn’t overreach; nor is it very compelling.  The plot is largely driven by Martin’s internal conflicts and continued bad decisions, but Martin as written is not a very appealing character and has few redeeming values beyond his desire to succeed and the perception that he’s been wronged.  The pacing is good, and the story is self-contained, but doesn’t offer much beyond capitalizing on a general fear of bad doctors and mismanaged care.  Recommended pass.
 
SUMMARY
 Having moved to California for his residency, MARTIN, a young doctor, struggles with the heavy workload and his inability to fit in socially with the other residents.  He takes an interest in a young, pretty patient named DIANE, making her laugh and engaging in conversation with her family.  After one of several conflicts with a nurse, THERESA, over the legibility of his work orders, MARTIN meets the orderly MIKE, who sympathizes with MARTIN and makes a crude joke about poisoning people.  DIANE recovers enough to be sent home, and her father invites MARTIN over for dinner. 
 
MARTIN arrives to dinner with DIANE’s family only to discover that DIANE isn’t there and that her father was trying to set him up with DIANE’s older sister.  MARTIN steals a photograph of DIANE and when his pager goes off, he makes his escape, leaving his jacket behind.  After a stressful meeting with his supervisor, DR. WAYLANS, MARTIN returns to DIANE’s house the next to pick up his jacket.  While there he replaces her antibiotic prescription with lactose pills and leaves an instruction to make sure she finishes her meds.  Shortly thereafter, DIANE is readmitted to the hospital and to MARTIN’s surprise, seems happier to be there with him than at school with her boyfriend.  MARTIN resolves to keep her there as long as he can and begins sabotaging her treatment and tests to ensure that he isn’t discovered.  After she has a minor surgical procedure, he switches out her IV, resolving that this will be the last time and that he will let her heal once she recovers.  After falling asleep for a while, he checks her room only to discover she is in the ER with a cardiac arrest.  She dies, and a grieving MARTIN becomes increasingly paranoid when the other doctors start treating him with more respect now that he has lost a patient.
 
MIKE accosts MARTIN, claiming to have DIANE’s diary with evidence of an inappropriate relationship.  MARTIN panics and capitulates to MIKE’s demands for prescription drugs, but when MIKE becomes more and more demanding, MARTIN poisons him instead.  The police come to MARTIN’s apartment to question him and he panics, climbing out of his bathroom window and contemplating suicide.  MARTIN’s ambition and desire to live win out, and he climbs back into his apartment and easily dismisses the police.  We last see him as an established doctor, injecting a little girl with a shot.

When 17-year old Josh is in danger of failing French and losing his acceptance into Stanford, his hard-partying father Hank– the president of “Girls Gone Loco”, hires a live-in French tutor to help Josh out.  When the tutor turns out to be young, beautiful Claire, both Josh and Hank scramble to win her affections.

COMMENTS
Juvenile but good-natured, it suffers from some pointless scenes and a general reliance on gross-out or sexual humor.  When the humor is situational it moves along well and is quite appealing with some good scenes especially between Hank and Josh.  However, there isn’t quite enough of this, and the presence of a few plot holes and some very stereotypical side characters serve to weaken it further.  Pass.

SUMMARY
JOSH and his friends STEVE and KYLE are in South Padre Island partying with co-eds on their spring break.  JOSH runs into his father, HANK, at a bar, drinking and convincing girls to flash their breasts for the camera as the president of “Girls Gone Loco,” a popular video series.  JOSH is disgusted and wants to return to the hotel to study for a test, but his father makes him stay out and party.

Back at school, JOSH has failed the French test, and is furious at his father.  HANK hires a French au pair, CLAIRE, who is convinced to stay after JOSH ask her to forgive HANK’s rudeness.  CLAIRE takes JOSH to see Breathless in order to understand the French better.  When they get home, HANK has cooked a gourmet meal, and is clearly interested in CLAIRE.

The next morning, CLAIRE is sunbathing topless by the pool.  HANK, flustered, tries to hide her from JOSH when HANK’s ex-wife and JOSH’s mom, JANE, arrives.  JANE is upset that CLAIRE is topless, but eventually is mollified and leaves with the old prom dress she hopes to wear to her high school reunion.

JOSH, HANK, CLAIRE, KYLE and STEVE play paintball against a team of high school jocks (one of whom, COLIN, is dating JENNY, a girl JOSH is interested in).  CLAIRE is the hero, but the game ends with JOSH and HANK shooting each other repeatedly.

JOSH’s French is beginning to improve, and he nervously heads off to a party while CLAIRE goes on a date with HANK.  CLAIRE and HANK end up playing strip putt-putt, only to have their date interrupted by the cops, and JOSH ends up riotously drunk, vomiting in JENNY’s cleavage and screaming in French in his underwear on the roof.  JOSH eventually recovers from his legendary hangover and find himself more popular at school than ever before, except with COLIN, who JOSH luckily manages to punch out during a brief fight.  He goes skinny-dipping with CLAIRE, and later confronts his father about their competition over CLAIRE.  CLAIRE witnesses this and returns to Paris, leaving a note for HANK and JOSH.  HANK tries to hide the note from JOSH and books a flight to Paris.  JOSH has to pass his French test, but manages to sabotage HANK at every step of the way.  JOSH finishes his test and gets to the airport in time to board the same flight as his father.  Arriving in Paris, they both scramble to find CLAIRE and eventually find her watching a mime performance.  She reveals that one of the mimes is her ex-boyfriend and HANK punches him, causing both HANK and JOSH to get beat up by a gang of angry mimes.  CLAIRE says goodbye to them and JOSH returns home while HANK takes a vacation in Nice with JANE.  We end at Stanford with JOSH meeting a hot girl who happens to speak French.

LOGLINE

In a post apocalyptic zombie world… old rivalries complicate the battles with zombies on a tiny Island off the British coast. 


COMMENTS

I had quite a hard time getting through this one, and the condensed summary reflects the fact that once you get the set up – it’s a zombie movie with soldiers and feuding wild west types on an island (???) the plot mainly consists of a bunch of escalating fights interspersed with one-linery type dialog.  The plot is so bizarre it makes my head hurt, the characters flat… some zombie movies are wonderfully unique additions to the genre (28 days later, Shaun of the Dead) but some are not.  That being said, Romero has been enjoying a renaissance recently, and if genre horror works this could be good, there’s plenty of blood and gore, but I don’t like the script. 

SUMMARY  (short)

On a small island facing a zombie plague the O’FLYNNs and MULDOONs continue their generations old feud.  O’FLYNN has become a killer, going house to house and killing any zombified loved ones, until SEAMUS MULDOON and his gang run O’FLYNN off the island.  O’FLYNN vows to flood the tiny island of PLUM with outsiders to exact revenge on Muldoon. 

Meanwhile, a group of national guard battle against “dead heads” as the zombies are called.  They kill zombies and find an abandoned armored car filled with money. They hear O’FLYNN on the radio telling everyone to come to PLUM Island where “if you get here… you’ll be welcome.” 

The guardsmen fight their way onto a ferry on the way to PLUM, fending off zombies and O’FLYNN’s men. On the island, O’FLYNN (now known as CAPTAIN COURAGEOUS?) MULDOON and the zombies and guardsmen fight, until the feuding winds uip taking the lives of all but a few of the guardsmen who decide to remain on the island and start their lives again.  “The world is fucked.”

LOGLINE

A skeptical writer who has made a fortune writing guide books that debunk mysterious presences and haunted houses, becomes a believer after checking into the truly terrifying room 1408. 

COMMENTS

There are a few lucid moments in this script, where the veteran writers succeed in raising the hair on your neck, but the script is loaded with so many ludicrous moments that its very hard to take seriously.  There are a few particular sequences that pushed the script over the top, particularly the dramatic scene where Mike desperately runs around the room trying to get signal for his wireless internet connection, and the sequence where the room actually starts to talk.  It’s strong enough that a lot of silliness can be forgiven, but 1408 is pretty ridiculous, and I don’t think it will be scary enough to attract many fans.

SUMMARY

MIKE ENSLIN is a writer who writes guide books chronicling his journeys to America’s “haunted” houses and graveyards.  Mike is naturally skeptic, and claims that in all his years of research, he has never once encountered an actual mysterious, otherworldly presence.  Nevertheless, he has a devoted following, his books are bestsellers, and his mailbox is constantly stuffed with brochures for various attractions trying to get included in his next publication.  

In his spare time, Mike enjoys unwinding by surfing.  During one outing, he gets distracted and nearly drowns after getting wiped out by a wave.   When he gets back home, he finds a mysterious letter in his mailbox – a postcard, simply inscribed, “Don’t Enter 1408,” with logo for the Dolphin Hotel on the back.  The jaded Mike is intrigued, especially after he calls the hotel and they refuse to let him book the room.  

Mike talks to his lawyer Sam, who finds a loophole in an old discrimination law, forcing the Dolphin Hotel to let Mike stay in the room.  At the hotel, the manager OLIN tries desperately to convince Mike to stay out “nobody has lasted more than an hour.”   He tells Mike that 56 people have died in the room since the opening of the hotel – some suicides, some heart attacks, one woman even drowned in a bowl of chicken soup.  “It’s an evil fucking room.”

After entering the room, Mike is underwhelmed by the sedate surroundings.  Mike looks out the window, and when he looks back into the room, he notices that the bed has been turned down and there are mints on the pillows.  Mike is convinced that Olin is playing a trick on him.  

The thermostat starts rising, and Mike cannot control it.  Getting suspicious, but still skeptical, Mike takes out his paranormal equipment and sprays a UV light around the room, immediately getting disgusted by the amount of bodily fluids that have left marks on the walls and bed.  He notices that the paintings on the wall are askew, and the thermostat temperature keeps rising.  Mike calls a serviceman, but the Engineer refuses to come into the room.  He remains in the hallway and tells Mike how to fix it himself, before leaving as quickly as he arrived.  

Mike looks out the window and notices, strangely, that the room is silent, there is no street noise at all, even though the window is open.  The window slams shut on Mike’s hand, breaking it badly.  When he washes it in the sink, the water scalds him.  He tries to open the door, but the key disappears.  Mike is trapped.

“I’m losing my mind.”  Mike begins having disturbing visions, and is convinced that the mint chocolate from his pillow was drugged.  He sees a video of his daughter on the television, and visions of various residents of 1408 who have died.  In the bathroom, Mike sees his father, old and unhappy at a nursing home.  Mike decides to climb out the window and tiptoe along the edge until he gets to the window for the room over.  After nearly falling to his death, Mike realizes that there are no other window to climb into.    Mike dives back into his room, and the room begins to shift shape- the window he climbed out of disappears.  The room starts to talk, “your daughter was eaten by wolves on the Connecticut turnpike.” “Are you a meat eater?”  

Freaked out, Mike tries to video chat with his ex wife LILY, screaming, “I’m in danger!”  The sprinklers in the room go off and destroy his computer.  Mike crawls through an air vent in another attempt to escape, but has more terrifying visions – he sees his ex wife talking to their young daughter “you’re father is probably out drinking,” and sees KEVIN OMALLEY, a former guest who cut his own throat while staying in the room.  The vent collapses, and Mike rushes back into 1408.  

The visions get more and more rapid and surreal, until Mike can take no more – just as soon as he thinks it’s over… he wakes up, on the shore in his hometown.  The whole thing was a dream – he hallucinated after being hit on the head by his surfboard.  

His ex, Lily comes to visit him, and the two reconcile their tattered relationship.  Mike starts writing a book about his experience, the first novel he’s written in years.  He goes to see his father in the nursing home, and is pleased to see his father recognize him.  Mike finishes his book, but just as he is about to mail it to the publisher, he realizes that he’s been hallucinating… he’s really back in 1408!  

The room, mimicking Mike’s voice, calls Lily and tells her to come to the room.  Mike realizes that if Lily makes it into the room, she’s going to die.  Mike burns down the room, and the entire hotel, going up in flames along with it.  

After his funeral, his lawyer Sam, receives a brand new copy of Mike’s manuscript, 1408.

LOGLINE

Based on the true story about the disappearance of KATIE MARKS, the beleaguered wife of troubled NYC millionaire DAVID MARKS, who many think was behind her disappearance.  When a NY state detective reopens the case twenty years later, witnesses begin to die mysteriously.


COMMENTS

Well written script about an equally fascinating and disturbing true story, featuring a great role for Gosling that has the earmarks of award potential.  The rest of the ensemble cast seems well suited for the picture, which does a strong job weaving the seventies rich nyc lifestyle with the harsh vibe of impending tragedy.  Even the detective subplot set in the present day plays well, as the forces of wealth and politics work to undercut the process of justice.  I like it very much.

SUMMARY

A WOMAN pushes garbage bags over a railing into a river.  In the back of the woman’s car we see a BLOODY BOW SAW. 

Present Day – DAVID MARKS, 60, is being interrogated in a Galveston Texas courtroom. 

1971 – David, in his twenties,  scruffy looking, but incongruously wearing a tuxedo is ordered by his father, real estate tycoon MR. MARKS, to attend to a leak in one of the families’ many properties.  David meets and becomes immediately besotted by the tenant KATIE.  “I began dating her and we moved in together almost immediately.” 

David and Katie move to Vermont together and open a health food store called ALL GOOD THINGS.  David’s father nearly demands that David return to the city to get involved in the family business.   Almost on a whim, David proposes to her.  Katie’s family is a bit worried, but Katie is excited. 

2000.  New York state detective MONCADA, recently divorced, decides to reopen the cold case of Katie Marks’ mysterious disappearance. “If she was scared of him, why did she go back?” 

70s Shortly after the wedding, David reluctantly joins the family business, moving Katie into a massive NYC penthouse, spending his days collecting money from sketchy tenants. Katie begins to look forward to planning a family, but David insists that he doesn’t want children.  When Katie eventually gets pregnant, he is furious, and the couple decide to have an abortion. Katie begins dreaming about going to med school, which causes another row, and David reveals that he’s  been having an affair. 

Katie does not leave, however, and David’s violent behavior begins to boil over, including a scary incident where David literally drags Katie out of her parent’s house by the hair. 

Present – Moncada investigates David’s friendship with a NYC socialite DEBORAH.  Deborah has been shaking David down for money and wrote a bestselling novel that included scenes about a rich NYC millionaire who’d killed his wife and gotten away with it.  Deborah gets killed. 

70s.  On the fateful night, David calls Katie and insists that she return to the city.  Terrified she tells her family, “if something happens, don’t let David get away with it.” She disappears that night.  David doesn’t report her missing for five days. 

Present. Moncada believes that David had the help of his friend Deborah in covering up the murder of Katie.  Years later, when the case was reopened, he hired a retired soldier to kill Deborah.  David then killed the soldier himself. David was tried for the murder of the soldier, but got off on a self defense plea.  David is a real estate investor living in Florida.  “We never had a chance.”

LOGLINE: 

A wealthy heart transplant patient is given anesthesia prior to surgery; however the necessary amount is not administered, thus the patient is able to hear and feel everything. He overhears a disturbing plot against him, yet he must figure out whether or not it is part of his imagination, or if it is really happening.

SUMMARY:

CLAY, a young and wealthy businessman, is at his girlfriend’s house, SAM. They are a flirtatious couple. They spend the morning together. Clay heads back to his house, which he shares with his mother, LILITH. Lilith is not aware of Clay and Sam’s relationship.  Clay meets his friend, DR. JACK HARPER, and they go fishing in the East River. Clay discusses his inability to tell his mother about Sam, then they discuss Clay’s late father; it appears to be the first time Clay is opening up about him. They go back to the hospital after fishing and discuss Clay’s condition: Clay needs a new heart.  He wants Jack to be his surgeon, yet his mother is pushing for DR. SHYER. Clay attends his company Halloween party that evening. After they get home, Sam drops by to have some paperwork signed. That evening she has an emotional breakdown. Clay tends to her. They both decide to inform Lilith of their engagement. At first, Lilith pretends to be okay with it, and then switches her sentiments; she is irate. 

Clay and Sam run off to get married. Jack is the best man. Just as Clay is about to accept his vows, he receives a page from the hospital: they found him a heart. They all rush to the hospital; Lilith meets them there with Dr. Shyer, however, Clay insists that Jack perform the operation. Clay wins the argument. They prep him for surgery. The scheduled anesthesiologist is not present, and a replacement is called in, LARRY. They knock out Clay. He slips into a dream world, where the NARRATOR takes us through his dreams and gives us an update on his condition. We are introduced to a fantasy world where Clay remembers his childhood and sees images of his parents at a disco. Suddenly, Clay is aware that he can hear and feel everything; he is alert yet paralyzed. He tries to scream for help, but he can’t. He tries to block out the pain by dreaming about happy things, by forcing himself to focus on Sam. Clay trusts Jack with his life, until he overhears him speaking to the other doctors and nurses about a plan. Clay finds out that everyone is in on a scheme to kill him; they are merely putting on an act with the surgery.  He cannot move in order to put a stop to any of this; all he can do is lie there, helpless. 

Clay struggles to decipher fantasy from reality. His senses are telling him he is being deceived by a friend he once trusted, yet his emotions do not want to accept what is unfolding. We are introduced to an OBJECTIVE CLAY. We see Objective Clay concurrently with regular Clay, although Objective Clay has the ability to travel about, whereas regular Clay is unable to move.

Lilith is growing impatient; she wants to know what condition her son is in. Sam goes to check up on Clay, in order to reassure Lilith of his well-being. We find out that Sam is in on the plans. Clay is devastated. We follow Objective Clay as he tried to make sense of things, as he travels deeper inside his subconscious to conjure up answers. The medical team informs Lilith that Clay didn’t make it through the surgery; nevertheless, Lilith follows her gut feeling and storms into the operating room to see for herself. She is suspicious of the team. She notices that Clay is still alive. Lilith is the same blood type as Clay; therefore her heart would qualify as a perfect match. Lilith manages to push Jack and Sam out of the room, securing the prep room. She overdoses on Clay’s medication and kills herself in order to provide Clay with a heart. We find out that Lilith had contacted Dr. Shyer and the authorities prior to entering the operating room. Dr. Shyer enters the operating room, accompanied by his team. They get to work attempting to revive Clay and transplant Lilith’s heart.

Lilith explains how she concluded that the whole procedure was a hoax. She reveals to Objective Clay, after her death, that his father was abusive and had an accidental death one Halloween. Clay is shocked, all these years he had thought his father was a great man. Dr. Shyer successfully transplants the heart. As Clay opens his eyes, the Narrator explains that the happenings are questionable. Did Clay really experience all that happened, or was it the “cruel imaginings of a chemical mind.” It no longer mattered, he was now awake…




COMMENTS:

The script is relatively well written, however the dialogue is quite cheesy at times. The topic that this script explores is an interesting one, though its presentation could be improved. The plot reminds us of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, wherein the bulk of the action takes place within the mind of someone sedated. We trace back childhood memories, juxtaposed with other random thoughts and memories, all the while trying to find some form of truth in all the images. The struggle, the frustration, and the use of fantasy must be vividly portrayed in order to capture the viewer.
The story does not portray a colorful array of characters. Not enough emphasis is given to developing the characters; they are merely there to service the overall plot. The only strong element of the story is its visual narrative. If the story is able to capture its audience with its visual effects and artistic illustrations, then perhaps it will show some potential. Otherwise, the story seems too much like a soap opera.

COMMENTS

As made clear by the summary, there are a TON of characters in this script, and none of them have been focused on very intensely.  Through the first 75 pages of the script, each character only appears in one or two scenes.  The writing itself is good, the scenes are interesting and the script moves along well, but I feel like the story is too much of a pastiche and there is not enough focus on a clear plot.  The ensemble cast is really good, and perhaps this film could be good if Emilio’s direction is able to utilize the talent he has assembled.  Given the recent surge in political interest in this country, with youngsters looking at Iraq as a modern day Vietnam, this is a good time for films celebrating the lost glory of liberals (many of whom finger Bobby’s death as the end of an era); however, I am not sure how interested the rest of the world will be in the death of a Kennedy who wasn’t even a President.  Does the love affair for the Kennedy’s cross over into Europe?  Nevertheless, the script is too unfocused and lacking a structure cohesive enough for me to recommend the film at this point.

TITLE: The Brothers Bloom
DIRECTOR: Rian Johnson
WRITER: Rian Johnson
CAST: Rachel Weisz
STATUS: Preproduction
GENRE: Comedy/ Crime Caper
READER: Steven Murphy

LOGLINE

The Brothers Bloom are orphans who grow up to be the world’s most successful con artist team.  Bloom falls in love with a mark, and wants to quit, so he begs his brother Steven to create a con that will allow him to get out of the con lifestyle.

COMMENTS

A very well written script that lags at times, but is ultimately satisfying. There are a bunch of clever bits and pieces in this script which Rian Johnson ties together nicely.  Small moments like the card cutting trick, the dried blood and other small details are wonderful.   Johnson, the writer and director of Brick, writes movies for smart people, making the audience work hard to follow the story, but ultimately rewarding them for their effort.  Perhaps my only concern is that the script’s plot and technique are so finely crafted that the characters almost seem like an afterthought.  They not very complex and their relationships are predictable (but still enjoyable).  This is a script with tons of brains, but could use perhaps a touch more heart.

SUMMARY 

STEVEN and BLOOM are brothers, orphans who spend their youth being kicked out of foster home after foster home for miscellaneous infractions ranging from violence to fraud.  Steven, jealous of rich kids that are constantly enjoying a better life, begins to create elaborate cons to cheat rich people out of their money.  Steven becomes a master at the creation of the cons, and Bloom becomes a master of executing the plans.

Twenty years later, Bloom is getting sick of the con game.  He wants to live an “unwritten life” free from Steven’s machinations and trickery.  Bloom feels empty, despite their smashing success.

Bloom quits, but is still unsatisfied, spending his time drinking and wasting his life.  Steven manages to convince him to come back for one last con – in New Jersey of all places.  The con is aimed at fleecing a rich heiress who has spent her entire life as a shut-in.  Steven’s master plan revolves around Bloom romancing this girl, much to Bloom’s chagrin.  Steven’s only rule to Bloom is “don’t fall in love with her.”

In order to meet her Bloom throws himself in front of PENELOPE’S  Lamborghini.  Penelope is cold and withdrawn at first.   She has spent her entire life inside her enormous mansion, protected from the outside world because her parents believed that she had deathly allergies (which it turns out, she did not).  She spent her life learning about all sorts of strange hobbies and languages, but never had any real adventures, a fact which Steven based his entire plan around.  

Bloom convinces Penelope to accompany him on a fantastic voyage, where he and Steven introduce her to the world of international smuggling.  Along with a crew of fellow con men, including “the curator,” and “the chink,” the Bloom brothers trick Penelope into believing that she has gotten involved in an elaborate plan to fleece the Russian mafia and sell a stolen manuscript to an Argentinian antique dealer.  

During the course  of the plan, Bloom defies his brother’s advice and inadvertently falls in love with Penelope.  The two, who have both yearned for more in life, finally seem happy, but Bloom knows that the entire romance has been a lie, and worse, that it’s been scripted by his brother.  Bloom sadly tells Penelope that they have conned her, and leaves, returning to Italy for a life of aimless drunkenness.  Months later, Penelope tracks him down.  Before long the two are embroiled in the smuggling ring again, believing that Steven has been kidnapped by Russians.  

Bloom frees his brother, but not before Steven is shot.   Steven convinces Bloom that this kidnapping was his final, masterpiece con, and convinces his brother that he was not shot at all.  Bloom is finally free to live his own life with Penelope, no longer a pawn in his brother’s elaborate schemes.  As Bloom and Penelope head off, Bloom takes a look at the “fake blood” he wiped off his brother and realizes that Steven had been shot by the Russians after all.  It wasn’t a con – his brother had actually sacrificed himself so that Bloom and Penelope could be happy – a fantastic trick indeed.

After the retirement of her husband, the neurotic wife of a champion butter sculptor enters the state competition herself and forms an unlikely rivalry with a young girl.
 
COMMENTS:
A central point of the script is that no one other than the characters involved knows or cares about the Iowa state butter sculpting competition. While this is often uproariously funny, the fact remains that there is no movie audience for a film about the Iowa state butter sculpting competition. No matter how well-crafted it might be, BUTTER simply does not have the gross-out humor or sugary sweet romantic entanglements usually required for mainstream American comedies.
 
SYNOPSIS:
ACT I. 
LAURA PICKLER brags about the high quality of the butter sculptures done by her husband, BOB, and how that used to be good enough in America. DESTINY, a 12-year-old black girl, makes her way through several bad matches with foster families. She claims that the first time she saw Laura and Bob Pickler, she hoped to be taken in by them, but a year from now, Destiny will know better. 

DANIELLE MATTINGLY, Destiny’s caseworker, returns Destiny to the transitional home after another bad foster care experience.

Bob receives a king’s welcome at the Iowa State Fair complete with the theme from ‘Rocky’ and a fog machine. His queen, Laura, steps through the fog to pose with Bob for photos and news cameras. They are the biggest celebrities in butter sculpture. Destiny, mesmerized, watches them on TV and immediately rushes out to buy her own butter and start carving. 

Laura oversees the crowd of adoring and overweight women seeking her husband’s attention, but she never feels threatened. But when Bob meets Destiny and sees her sculpture ‘ that is different.

Destiny settles in with her new foster parents, JILL and ETHAN EMMET. At a Butter Gala, ORVAL ANDERSON, main judge of the Iowa State Mastery in Butter Committee, introduces Bob and shows a homemade video of interviews with Bob’s adoring fans celebrating his 15 year domination of butter carving. An overdressed Laura holds court with Bob’s admirers at the Gala. 

Orval pulls Bob aside and asks him to retire from competition and join the judging committee so that someone else has a chance to win. Orval worries Laura may not take the news very well.

At the Pickler home, Laura stamps around screaming and swearing about this turn of events. KAITLIN, Bob’s 16-year-old and Laura’s step-daughter, observes Laura’s meltdown. Bob tries to calm Laura and tell her losing their butter empire may not be that big of a deal, but Laura will have none of it. 

Orval and his wife, HELEN, relax in front of the TV in their recliners. Laura pounds on the door, demanding to speak to Orval. Orval hides and Helen reluctantly lets Laura in, but Orval sneaks out and drives away. Laura promises this is not over.

Bob sits in a rundown strip club watching an unenthusiastic dance by BROOKE SOSNOWSKI, stage name Tokyo Rose. Laura drives home, convincing herself the world is simply jealous of her. Brooke grinds on Bob and seductively manipulates him into paying her rent. On her way home, Laura sees the family minivan rocking back and forth in the parking lot of the seedy strip club. She slams on the brakes, cuts across the highway median, and hurtles her SUV into the minivan. 

Back at the house, as Bob ices his crotch, Laura lectures Bob and announces her plan to enter the sculpting competition herself.

ACT II. 
Ethan drops off Destiny for her first day of private school. A boy in her class, HAYDEN, loans her a pencil, and MRS. SCHRAM, the art teacher, encourages Destiny’s artwork. The friendliness of the kids and teachers at the previously all-white school catches Destiny by surprise. On the way home, she asks Ethan to buy her a mass quantity of butter.

Laura informs Kaitlen of her plan to enter the sculpting competition to a less than enthusiastic response. A knock at the door interrupts the family meeting. Bob answers and finds Brooke standing outside. Kaitlen thinks Brooke might be her father’s hooker, which instead of angering her, excites Kaitlen that something might actually be happening in the suburbs. Bob offends Brooke by telling Kaitlen that Brooke is nobody, so Brooke smacks the minivan with her purse.

Laura shocks NANCY FULKES, the woman working the registration desk for the butter sculpting competition, by signing up for the contest. So far, no one else from the county has signed up, so Laura wants Nancy to end the registration and leave early. In the parking lot, Ethan offers encouragement to Destiny to help her follow through and join the competition. At the last minute, CAROL ANN, one of Bob’s biggest fans, signs up for the contest and is excited to be competing with Laura. 

Then, Destiny and, surprisingly, Brooke enter their names in the competition. Laura objects to Brooke’s entry on the grounds Brooke looks like a hooker. Brooke pulls Laura aside, and Laura puts Brooke in her place. Nonetheless, Brooke signs up just to irritate Laura.

Laura unsuccessfully tries to have Brooke disqualified. The competition begins. Carol Ann’s piece turns into a complete mess. Laura’s turns out fairly well, but Destiny crafts a fantastic butter sculpture. Jill finds the whole thing to be pretty strange, but Ethan encourages her to support Destiny. 

A group of cub scouts, led by Hayden, checks out the competition. Hayden focuses on Destiny until Brooke shows up after skipping the first 2 days of the competition. The scouts stare as Brooke goes to work wearing her skimpy tank top in the cold butter cooling unit. As quickly as she came, Brooke leaves again. Nancy counts down to the end of the competition.

The contestants take an opportunity to speak to the judges. A very nervous Carol Ann warbles through an awkward and self-deprecating speech. Brooke, cleaned up and presentable, lies through a speech about renouncing her whorish ways and embracing Jesus Christ, which earns the sympathy of the crowd despite her patently awful sculpture. Destiny gives a moving speech about her experiences in foster care and daring to dream big, which pumps up the crowd. 

Laura, flustered by the response to Destiny, fails to impress with her words. Seeing the competition slipping away, Laura takes one last chance. She reminds the judges the competition should be about butter sculpture quality. She runs down her fellow sculptors and reminds everyone she should not be penalized simply because she is white and beautiful and did not have to overcome the same deficiencies as her competition. This offends some of the spectators, but most of them and the judges see Laura’s point.

Nancy pulls Laura aside to tell her there are some questions whether the excellent sculpture is really her own work. Laura promises a media storm if she does not win the competition. Nancy announces the results of the contest. Carol Ann is pleased to have won fourth place. Brooke takes third and quietly tells Destiny to do all she can to beat Laura. 

Nancy announces Destiny as the winner, and Laura is abandoned as everyone rushes in to congratulate Destiny. On the way home, Laura swears and rants about the contest. She gets into a nasty, mean-spirited war of words with Kaitlen that leaves her stepdaughter in tears.

At the house, Laura finds something online that seems to cheer her up. The Emmets, Hayden, and Destiny celebrate the contest victory. They hear tires screeching outside and find that someone has spray-painted a website on their garage door. The website contains a YouTube video of Jill leading a PETA protest against Land O' Lakes butter, the sponsor of the sculpting competition, back in 1991.

Under the pretense of getting the minivan repaired, Laura visits the car dealership owned by her old high school boyfriend, BOYD BOLTON. While cleaning off the spray paint, Jill worries aloud that she is not equipped to deal with being a mother, which Destiny overhears. Kaitlen smokes weed in her bedroom. Brooke throws a rock against Kaitlen's window to get her attention. Kaitlen, genuinely interested in Brooke, wants to share her problems and ask a lot of questions. Brooke only wants to know where to find Bob's money.

Laura sneaks away to the dealership in the middle of the night to sleep with Boyd. Brooke reluctantly fools around with Kaitlen so she can get to Bob's money. Boyd takes a moment to say a prayer thanking God for sending Laura over to sleep with him. 

Nancy calls in Destiny and the Emmets for a meeting with Laura, Bob, and MARTIN CASWELL, a Land O’ Lakes executive, regarding the YouTube video. Martin wants Destiny to denounce Jill’s actions if she wishes to continue to the State level of the competition. Destiny runs out of the room in tears.

Ethan tries to comfort her. He is honest about his and Jill’s fears about babies, since Destiny tells him she overheard Jill’s worries. He does little to soothe Destiny other than treating her like an adult, but Destiny walks back in the meeting and refuses to denounce Jill. Martin, moved by Destiny’s conviction, allows her to continue with the competition anyway. 

When her first plan fails, Laura brings in Boyd who reads a prepared statement claiming he was bribed to help with Destiny’s butter sculpture. It becomes fairly obvious Laura put Boyd up to telling this lie, but with a hint of doubt now cast over the sculpting competition, Destiny agrees to a sculpting rematch with Laura. No longer needing his services, Laura ignores Boyd after the meeting. Jill throws her full support behind Destiny.

ACT III. 
Bob warns Laura how much work the rematch will be, and she alludes to a back-up plan. Destiny reveals potential subjects for her next sculpture: Ike and Tina Turner, Marie Antoinette at the guillotine, and several others. Jill, Ethan, and Hayden all agree on the last one that Destiny shows them. Carol Ann comes over with a pie to apologize for supporting Laura and pledge her future support to Destiny.

Kaitlen, lost in post-coital bliss, mumbles to Brooke about moving away and getting an apartment together. Brooke keeps her single-minded focus on the money until Kaitlen remembers and gives her a wad of cash. Brooke picks up Destiny and buys her expensive knives for butter sculpting. 

It pains Brooke to pass up on the sexy underwear she could buy for work, but getting back at Laura Pickler is worth the sacrifice. Someone in a yellow Mustang from Boyd’s dealership watches Brooke and Destiny come out of the mall.

Danielle visits the Emmets. Child services have located Destiny’s mother, but she has passed away. Destiny reveals little emotion at the news, but that night she speaks to her mother as if in prayer. Destiny forgives her mother and invites her to the sculpting competition if she can watch from heaven.

Laura and Destiny get to work on the day of the rematch. A standing room only crowd flocks to the event. Laura experiences some difficulties getting her sculpture to hold together. Nancy counts down the end of the competition, and the artists reveal their work. Destiny shows a butter sculpture of a new mother cradling a baby, and Laura shows her sculpture of Jackie O. in the Presidential limo immediately after JFK’s assassination. The crowd turns on Laura, finding the sculpture in poor taste. Nancy announces the judging will take place the following day.

That night, a dark figure sneaks in and melts Destiny’s sculpture with a crème brulee torch. Ethan loses it the next day when Nancy refuses to give Destiny the opportunity to fix her sculpture. His rant about the health risks and general worthlessness of butter greatly offends the gathered crowd. 

Destiny tries to wish Laura luck, and Laura lets her guard down for just a moment, telling Destiny butter sculpting is all that is left to Laura but Destiny has many opportunities.

Orval, head judge of the rematch, announces Destiny as the winner. Destiny hugs Laura for making her a better competitor. Laura, unsure what to do, smiles a genuine smile for the first time in years. She mellows a great deal after losing the competition. Destiny takes second at the butter sculpting state championship. Jill and Ethan officially adopt her.

A successful woman learns she has cancer and falls in love with her doctor as she’s dying.
 
COMMENTS
I read an earlier draft with Sandra Bullock, and it’s a shame she’s out because the dialog really crackles and she would have done well with it; the lead character is fun and funny despite the fact that she is dying, but Hudson is so bland I think the film will suffer.  They altered the draft only slightly from the version I read a year ago; the Doctor character is tweaked for Bernal (he’s dreamier!) and the plot is slightly different, but largely similar… and she still dies at the end. There are currently two competing cancer comedies – this and the one from Lionsgate… which is odd, because the subject is depressing and the funny dialog still wouldn’t make me want to watch this movie.   It should be said that this is definitely more Mirjam’s cup of tea; it’s inherently a chick flick, and it’s definitely funny at parts, so perhaps give it a look, despite the dark subject matter.
 
SUMMARY
MARLEY is a successful female ad exec who values her career over her social life and treats men like sex objects; frequenting a set of late night bootie calls but refusing to settle down.
 
Her friend and coworker SARAH fears that MARLEY looks sick; so Marley winds up at a specialist’s, cute young JULIEN… while sedated MARLEY sees WHOOPI GOLDBERG  / GOD (Marley’s vision of god looks like Whoopi) and God tells her that she’s dying, but that she gets three wishes.  To fly; to get a million bucks, and … she doesn’t come up with a third. “You know what it is but you won’t admit it.”
 
MARLEY reluctantly begins chemo and slowly breaks the news to her friends, family and finally her boss. Strangely, Marley's wishes start to come true, as Marley wins a radio call in show for a free sky diving trip and her company gives her a million dollar insurance settlement for contracting a terminal disease.
 
In the meantime, Marley starts a relationship with her doctor Julian, who eventually loosens up and grows to care for Marley to such an extent that he refers her to another doctor and begins dating her.  The two fall quickly in love, but when Julian admits his feelings, Marley panics and breaks it off.  Her condition quickly gets worse and she works to amend things with her parents and her friends.  Eventually as she's on her death bed, with her friends and loved ones gathered round, Julian arrives and tells her that he loves her only moments before she dies and (for presumably the first time in her life she’s ever said it to a man) she tells him she loves him too.

Dark comedy about two mentally challenged individuals. 

COMMENTS 
David O Russell has been disappointing me lately. I wonder who wants to see this film. The lead character is a mental patient living in a mental institute. He is picked up a bit too early by his mother and brought home. He is still in love with his ex-wife (well, they are still married, but she wants nothing to do with him after he caught her with another man and he  the guy.)

After his return from the mental hospital he meets the sister of his neighbor, another mentally unstable character. After her husband died, she thinks she needs to sleep with every man, in order to win their friendship/love/approval.

A story about misfits. I think David O Russell thinks it's dark humor. I think it's a movie that will fall flat flat flat. The characters stay the same. There is no growth, insight, smart humor. I found it sad and who wants to see a sad film? It could turn out to be touching, but I wouldn't bet on it right now. 

SUMMARY
Pat Peoples, a former high school history teacher, life is all about trying to look on the bright side of things – the “silver linings” of the title.  Recently released from the mental institution, Pat believes he has only been gone for a few months – when in fact he’s been gone for four years – and tries to reconcile with his wife who has since left him for another man.  Trying to remain resolutely undiscouraged, Pat moves back in with his parents and tries to become the man his wife always wanted him to be.  Along the way, Peoples meets Tiffany, a beautiful, but mentally unstable young woman whose life also has not turned out the way she wanted.  Each day as Pat heads out for a 10-mile run, Tiffany silently trails him, refusing to be shaken off by the object of her affection. The odd pair try to navigate a timid friendship, but as Pat is unable to discern friend from foe and reality from deranged optimism, every day proves to be a cringe-worthy adventure.

A writer lives in a B&B that bears the same name, and served as the inspiration for, his greatest work; but his family life is thrown into flux when he meets and falls for his new 17 year old maid, who also becomes his daughter’s best friend.

COMMENTS
A rather charming, fun little script; I don’t think its an urgent prebuy, except maybe for AUS or UK (which is likely gone); it’s got a bit of a Little Miss Sunshine feel to it; though the project is nothing like that… just a funny tone with a broad range of troubled, unique characters – there are some really laugh out loud moments, (including an argument at a costume party, and some comic relief from the youngest daughter) as well
as other moments of pain and heart wrenching emotion.   Could be something
for BLX, or FR, though I think it’s more of an English speaking territory movie; not for indo, mid east, lat am, etc.

SUMMARY
EMELIA, a 17 year old rebel, takes a job at CLIFF HOUSE; a famed B&B and home to writer JONATHAN (who wrote the novel CLIFF HOUSE which made the place famous), and his wife, JOA, and daughter BETH.  Beth seems suspicious of Emelia, who claims her name is “Serena Molina the cleaner.”

On her first day on the job EMELIA goes into the attack where she finds Jonathan jerking off to internet porn. He is completely embarrassed; while she seems amused.

JOA and JONATHAN get into a fight over their youngest daughter, POSY, about taking her out of school to rehearse for a professional play. JOA hits him with a low blow, insulting his writing and calling him a failure.

After work, EMELIA tries to buy wine at a market; when she gets carded, she shows  the teen her tits… it works.  JOA and JONATHAN are not excited BETH has invited “the bloody help” to dinner.  Jonathan, in particular, is extremely uncomfortable; “I hope you’ve washed your hand,” she jokes, impishly.

EMELIA asks about Cliff House; JONATHAN tells her he wrote the book at 22, it was a big success, and now it “hangs around my neck taunting me with its success.” Emelia tells tem that she’s related to Arthur Conan Doyle and that she’s writing her first novel.

Jonathan runs into Emelia while she’s at her other job waitressing at a local café; he is impressed by her “firecracker wit” and offers to teach her creative writing.

JOA takes a disliking to Emelia, who is insolent and disobeyant as staff; and a bad influence on Beth.

Beth invite Emelia on a trip to Oxford, but gets her feelings hurt when Emelia rudely turns her down.  A few days later, Emelia relents and agrees to go.

While JOA takes Posy to London for an audition; Jonathan plays hooky, leaving the B&B unattended while he leads EMELIA on an excursion to Arthur Conan Doyle’s gravesite.  On the trip, Emelia kisses Jonathan; he doesn’t pull away; in fact, he quite enjoys it. He gets home to find JOA, furious, “how could you not notice that bloody girl didn’t show up?”

Emelia comes to her writing tutoring session and starts making out  with Jonathan; she disrobes and the two kiss passionately.  She takes things further by arriving at Posy’s Birthday costume party dressed as Princess Leia, in a shockingly revealing bikini.  Jonathan, dressed as the pope; pulls her into a cupboard and has quick, unsatisfying sex with her.  Joa nearly catches him, but gets distracted when she finds that BETH is drunk; the three have an argument. Jonathan tries to stand up for Beth, but winds up accidentally insulting her.

Emelia and Beth go to Oxford; and the first night there they tear it up, getting wasted. Beth wakes up, shocked to find herself in bed with a strange man, a used condom on the floor next to her… to make matters worse, her interview has been made earlier; BETH has to take it completely hungover, but she pulls herself together.

Back at the cliff house everything boils over; JONATHAN and EMELIA have a stand off; she accuses him of being a terrible writer, and they break it off.  BETH, who’s been feeling sick all week, takes a pregnancy test; and gets caught by her mother JOA. Beth yells “FUCK OFF!” and slams the door, sobbing. Joa confronts Jonathan, “do you know your daughter is having sex?”

Jonathan admits he’s been having sex with emelia; and Joa explodes so loudly that Beth hears her. Beth is devastated. Emelia, humiliated.  Joa kicks Jonathan out.

Beth devastates Emelia by revealing that Emelia is not really related to Arthur Conan Doyle.

Months later, Jonathan reconciles with his daughter, who is going off to college.  Emelia writes a book, called “Albatross.”

In 1898 Dublin, a supremely diligent and able -- as well as extremely private, shy and unworldly – forty-something waiter in a slightly fading hotel, is in fact a woman. When she encounters another woman-living-as-a-man and learns that he/she is married, the deeply lonely waiter begins fantasizing having a home and someone with whom to share his life.  Despite the risks, the waiter courts a vivacious maid who is involved with a rough, deeply angry, workman.  
 
COMMENTS  
There is no denying the power of the great Irish writer George Moore's famous 1927 short story, a favorite text in feminist and gender studies. As for the screenplay, it has lots of names on it and I won't guess who did what although I understand that the distinctly high-brow Irish writer's writer John Banville is the primary force in the current version. The screenplay, which creates a convincing world and features both the dramatic and subtle visual storytelling one associates with a director and the precise sense of the characters' inner life one associates with a novelist, is very good and much richer and nuanced than the synopsis suggests. The first half is particularly fine; the latter half seems much less focused and somewhat repetitive. 

There are aspects of the project which give me pause. One is that Ms. Close, who is a great actress, is considerably older than the character – which does affect how we think of Albert.  Another is Albert's profound oddity, by which I mean the effectiveness and ignorance of the world and its ways which are central to the suspense and deeply poignant – but also a bit under-illuminated and hard to believe. Which raises the issue of whether today's audiences can appreciate – or if the script makes it adequately clear – how cruelly repressive society, and particularly Irish society, was at that time.  

However, when one considers the story and the artists involved – Moore, Banville, Close and the rest of the cast -- this seems to me to have considerable Smarthouse potential, albeit of the distinctly upscale literary variety. 

MW COMMENTS
Danish Girl meets The Extra Man. I wonder if Rodrigo Garcia can give this a cinematic richness it needs. Mother and Child was such a visual bore. With this film you can't afford that. Not a pre-buy.
   
SUMMARY 
Dublin, 1898. At Morrison's Hotel, slight forty-something waiter ALBERT NOBBS does his job with a Chaplainesque focus and expertise. But Albert is also oddly affectless, uneasy with people, very private and very alone. Unlike his colleagues, Albert locks the door of the sparsely furnished attic room where, at the end of his long work day he counts his tips, adds them to the small fortune he has hidden beneath a floorboard and enters the sum in a battered bible that also contains a photograph of a woman he resembles – a woman Albert believes is his mother. 

Forced for a night to share his bed with HUBERT PAGE, a handsome, vigorous house painter, Albert accidentally reveals to us and Hubert that  ... he is a woman. Desperate and weeping, Albert begs Hubert not to tell anyone “or stop a poor woman making a living.” Hubert's reaction is enigmatic but he promises not reveal Albert's secret. 

The next day, Albert, fearing that her scene with Hubert was overheard, is anxious to talk with the painter but unfortunately, all the women at Morrison's want to be around Hubert. When Albert is finally alone with the painter, Hubert reveals to the shocked waiter that he – or she -- too is a woman. More astonishing, Hubert is married – and to a woman “You could do it yourself,” declares Hubert. But the painter leaves the hotel before the innocent Albert can ask the many questions – “When did he tell his wife he was a woman?” “Did he tell her before the wedding or after?” – swirling through her head. 

The hotel's proprietress, MRS. BARKER, hires a workman, JOE MACKINS, a young man of intense sexual energy, frustrated ambition, and violent resentment. HELEN, a vivacious and sensual maid, and Joe soon begin an intense affair. And Joe almost as quickly senses something “off” about Albert. 

Inspired by Hubert, Albert is overwhelmed by fantasies of being married – of opening a shop and sharing her life with someone. But its apparent Albert knows as little about commerce as she does sexual relationships.  

To the surprise of her colleagues, Albert takes a half off and leaves the hotel. She tracks down Hubert and his/her wife, who welcome the odd waiter into their home. There, Albert seems to relax and, for the first time in the film, smiles. And she tells Hubert her story. A bastard who has never been close to anyone but her nanny, Albert received a convent education until her mother's family ceased paying the tuition. She found herself at fifteen casts into the most horrifying slums and after being gang-raped, she stole a suit of clothes and got a job as waiter.   

Albert, egged on by Joe, sets her eyes on Helen, who only accepts Albert's invitations to “walk-out” because Joe wants to know if Albert has money. She has nothing to say to the vital Helen and is deeply anxious about spending money. Nonetheless, Albert buys the maid whatever Helen wants and Helen is touched by the waiter's manners.  

Ireland is hit by an epidemic of typhoid fever that strikes Mrs. Baker and Albert, among others at the hotel. While Albert withdraws to his room, living on food left at his door by one of the maids, MARY, the proprietress is cared for by Helen and Joe. When she recovers, Baker rewards Joe with the offer of a better job – one the workman, to his deep, deep fury, can't accept because he's illiterate. 

When Albert recovers, she rushes to Hubert and finds the painter in mourning for her wife. After Albert clumsily suggesting they might marry, the saddened Albert explains to Hubert that she, “Can't remember, anymore, what it feels like … to be a woman.” Going to the closet of Hubert's departed wife, the two dress as women for the first time in decades and leave the house. Albert is transported and exuberantly runs through the winter sunshine – until she stumbles and falls and the mood is suddenly lost. 

Helen is pregnant and she and Joe begin to violently argue. Albert seizes the chance to propose to Helen, who scoffs at the notion; Albert has never even kissed her. When Helen demonstrates what a real kiss is, Albert, who never kissed his nanny like that, can't understand what it has to do with love. Keeping after the maid, Albert blurts out that Joe will leave Helen and her baby. Furious, Helen attacks Albert and then, despairing, allows the waiter to embrace and comfort her. For a moment they are close. But, finally, Helen rejects him. 

Albert is overwhelmed with a grief that only deepens when she hears Joe repeating the humiliating story of Albert's ignorance of kissing. 

Seeing Joe beat a man, Albert goes to Helen's door and once more proposes. Joe, who is furious, bursts from the room screaming at the cowed Albert. Helen and the other maids try to intervene and when Albert sees Joe about to hit Helen, something snaps and she throws herself upon the man. In the tumult, Albert's head slams against a doorjamb. As the fracas escalates and Joe and Helen's relationship unravels to its bitter end, Albert, blood streaming from his ear, stumbles to his room, crawls into bed and dreams of his fantasy home. 

Months later, Hubert is back working at Morrison's Hotel, which Mrs. Baker is restoring using the money she found in the late Albert's room.  Helen, now a kitchen maid, tells Hubert that she has to work for free, otherwise Mrs. Baker will tell the priest that her child is illegitimate – and Helen would lose the child. “Well now,” says Hubert. “We can't let that happen can we?” From afar we see Hubert talking to a dumbstruck Helen, no doubt proposing an unusual marriage.

 A bio of LINDA LOVELACE, the troubled star of the seminal 70s porno flick DEEP THROAT. 
 
COMMENTS 
It’s a pretty interesting story; excruciatingly violent and explicitly sexual… the sexuality is quite troubling, featuring imagery of rape, violent abusive sex and nearly a scene including bestiality.  The DEEP THROAT sequence is the only part of LOVELACE’s life that had any public recognition and I was definitely intrigued by quite how terrible her life was, but it didn’t seem unbelievably unique to me. It’s a true story, but as a film it seemed to cover angles I’ve seen before in stronger films.  Its from the director of the Sundance Movie HOWL; who’s film I havent’ seen.  I don’t like the title or the religious angle either; for most of the movie, LINDA just seems naïve and innocent and for me, didn’t try hard enough to escape (I feel guilty even writing that!)   Could be controversial and interesting for arthouse audiences; for me was just a bit lacking. 
 
SUMMARY 
LINDA BOREMAN, a religious, a beautiful, teen girl gets into a terrible car accident. In VO, she explains that after the accident, “everything changed for me. The way I saw me, and the world and everything in it.” 
 
LINDA meets and falls for a sexy Marlboro Man type named CHUCK TRAYNOR. He’s flashy and cool, but their whirlwind romance goes bad quickly. Shortly after they get marriage she realizes that he’s basically a pimp, and to make matters worse, he starts badly beating her and forcing her to have sex with strange men for money.  She tries twice to escape, turning to another hooker first, and finally to her parents, but CHUCK’s power over her seems insurmountable. 
 
CHUCK introduces LINDA to a porno director GERARD, who talks them into putting her into a movie called DEEP THROAT.  Everyone is blow away by Linda’s performance but CHUCK starts to get jealous and badly beats her within earshot of the crew.  LINDA meekly explains that she fell down. “I’m klutzy.” 
 
The film is a massive hit and makes LINDA a celebrity. CHUCK is along for the ride. At the playboy mansion, she meets HEF but is humiliated when CHUCK tries to force her to have sex with a German Shephard in front of everyone.  
 
LINDA finally leaves CHUCK after he explodes on the set of one of her films.  She takes up with a seemingly nice old man named RONNY SUMMERS and they have a wonderful few months together, but he eventually snaps. He slaps her and starts bossing her around and LINDA explodes, beating him nearly to death.  
 
LINDA quits the business and writes a book about her ordeal, explaining that the Lord helped her escape the life. She becomes an advocate for abolishing porn.   She dies in 2002 after an SUV accident.

DIRECTOR: Gilles Bourdos

GENRE: Psychological Thriller
READER: Rob Ruminski / Comments by Steven Murphy

LOGLINE – A man faces his past and his own mortality when a mysterious doctor enters his life, claiming to have the ability to foresee death.

COMMENTS

Critical and commercial trends – aka the law of diminishing returns – would suggest that the world no longer has much use for M Night Shyamalan-style suspense-free supernatural “thrillers”, so I’m not sure why anyone thinks that yet another knock-off imitation of the same formula is a good idea, either artistically or commercially.  Utterly average in every way.  PASS

SM COMMENTS – DR. Kay’s mysterious messenger is the most interesting part of this mediocre thriller, and Malkovitch should imbue the role with a significant amount of creepiness, but the story isn’t remarkable. Not a prebuy.


	
SUMMARY

Opens on YOUNG NATHAN and YOUNG CLAIRE (though we don’t know it yet) in Central Park, playing near an icy pond in winter.  Claire falls through, Nathan pulls her out and runs for help, getting hit by a car in the process.  Images of Nathan’s ‘spirit’ floating away in an out-of-body experience segue into voiceovers and images of Young Nathan speaking of his experiences to DR KAY (unidentified, off-screen), which in turn give way to images of ADULT NATHAN – a successful corporate lawyer – and Dr. Kay making their way through the city and to work.
	Early scenes with his assistant establish that Nathan is cutthroat and immersed in his work, separated from CLAIRE, now his wife, and their daughter TRACEY.  Dr Kay comes to visit Nathan at work, posing as a potential client.  The meeting unsettles Nathan, as Kay exhibits a great deal of knowledge about Nathan’s life, making cryptic suggestions about impending doom and offering to help.  Though shaken, Nathan dismisses him as a crackpot.
	Scenes of Kay on his own in the city are marked by strange visions from Kay’s POV, in which light like halos shines around the heads of random people on the street.  We see one of these people die in a freak accident.
	That night, Kay approaches Nathan again, asks him to give a few minutes of his time. Nathan reluctantly agrees, and goes with the older man to a subway platform, where Kay points out a man on the opposite platform and says that the stranger will die in a few moments.  Kay disappears, as Nathan watches the man throw himself in front of a train.
	When Nathan tracks down Kay again and demands answers, Kay claims that he is one of The Messengers, a select few who can see death before it happens.  The duty of a Messenger, claims Kay, is to assist the dying to find some peace in life before they die.  He draws Nathan’s attention to ANNA, a childhood friend from his past, says that she is going to die.  With the information that Kay has given him, Nathan tracks down Anna.
	A waitress and single mother who has fallen on hard times, Anna is shocked but pleased with the sudden reappearance of Nathan in her life.  As their friendship blossoms, tragedy strikes:  after convincing Anna not to attempt to repair some faulty wiring herself, her elderly father dies after attempting to fix it himself.  In spite of the tragedy, Nathan is elated – this means that, contrary to Kay’s assertions, the living can intervene and save the lives of the dying.  Though her father died, Anna was very much alive as the result of Nathan’s intervention.
	Meanwhile, the audience has been shown, through a series of flashbacks, the reason for  Nathan and Claire’s estrangement:  while on a family holiday, their infant son succumbs to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome.  The furious Nathan lashes out at everyone around him, including his wife, who leaves with Tracey, moving across the country to Arizona.
	Back in the present, Nathan continues to try and help Anna, offering to loan her some money to help with the expenses relating to her father’s death.  When they go to the bank to pick up the money, they get caught in the crossfire of a botched robbery.  Anna is killed by a stray bullet.
	Despondent, putting the pieces together, Nathan reaches out to Kay, in the belief that he is about to die.  Kay denies once again that he has any ability to see a specific time of death (the earlier train suicide was an educated guess).
	After much discussion and anguish – including the revelation that Kay was the doctor that he spoke with after his near-death experience as a child – Nathan starts to accept his fate, and heads to Arizona to get his daughter Tracey and bring her back for a visit, as she doesn’t want to fly alone.  Nathan asks Kay to come along for moral support, and to ensure that Nathan isn’t somehow inadvertently putting his daughter into danger.
	Once in Arizona, Nathan decides to stay, attempting to make amends with Claire, and find some closure or resolution in his life.  After waking up in the morning after a night that he was sure would bring his death, Nathan’s surprise and joy are shattered when he sees a halo of light around Claire’s head, exactly fitting Kay’s description of his own visions.  Frantic, he calls Kay, who has secretly skipped his return flight to New York, staying behind – he has known the truth about Nathan all along, and only allowed him to believe in his impending death as a necessary step in the process of realizing his abilities as a Messenger.  Understanding now, Nathan rushes back to Tracey and Claire, a family again, with Nathan promising never to leave Claire’s side.

(Mirjam) - Very introspective, no humor, very sad, as she was clearly mentally challenged.  It will be a great part for Naomi Watts, even though she is physically completely different.  She is a great actress and can pull it off.  Since it has a bleak tone, it will be less commercial, but still an interesting project for the right price.  This is a Recommend.

(Marc Smit) Very much an introspective script, we see everything from her perspective.  Death looms from the outset and there is no humor whatsoever.  There's heavy use of voice over and real Marilyn Monroe songs.  Becoming an actress is a way for her to feel like she is becoming someone.  She is invested in her characters completely.  There's very little time to enjoy it as she is quickly caught up in the fame.  Films become her only reality, surrounding characters become distant voices.  She is on her own and is slowly drowning.  As the story unfolds she loses grip, and insanity is looming.  It becomes more and more abstract and claustrophobic.  She tries to hang onto herself but the world does not allow it.  Sex with the president is the final stroke.  She kills herself thereafter.  The film has the pace and structure of Jesse James.  Naomi Watts doesn't look like Marilyn or have her figure, but she is a great actress and should be able to capture that essence.  Some of the scenes here reminiscent of Watts performance in Mullholland Drive.

Strong script and great story. but tough proposition.  It will become a good movie, but to what estent the angle on it will attract large crowds is difficult, especially considering Jesse James.  There's a chance for Watts to win an Oscar.",,

READER: Steven Murphy

LOGLINE

“A road movie set entirely in a flat.” A young, lazy man, recalls a cross euro trip he took with his best friend BUNNY, vividly remembering their trip while never leaving his apartment.

COMMENTS

An insanely off beat comedy, from the creators of an insanely off beat British TV series, (THE MIGHTY BOOSH), this is not going to appeal to everyone, but the creators have a legion of cult fans and this humor appeals very much to the same fan base.  This story is crazy crazy crazy and there’s a ton of stylistic (self described Michel Gondry type) gimmickry sure to add to the film’s odd ball appeal.  It’s a simple road story told with some innovative quirks, but at its heart it’s a buddy comedy about two guys, a troubled free spirit and his meek, nervous buddy.  Featuring scenes with the lead character getting gored in the penis, an extended scene about fucking dogs, and quite a bit of chatting about a fast food restaurant’s mysterious “vegetarian” option, this will not be palatable to everyone, but I like it and there’s potential cult video fan base, especially if MIGHTY BOOSH has caught on in your territory.  Chances are, this is too strange, and its certainly not going to have the crossover appeal of a Gondry film, but its funny oddball stuff.


SUMMARY

The following tale is told in a variety of styles, recounted by Stephen and  an “imaginary” version of his real life best friend Bunny as they sit in Stephen’s apartment and hallucinate the various scenes.  The restaurant is made of cardboard, the ice field scene takes place in the freezer, etc. 

Flashback - STEPHEN and BUNNY win a bunch of money gambling on a long shot horse. They take the money and use it to fund a rail trip throughout Europe. Stephen over packs and over plans, using guidebooks to map out every moment of their itinery, but the laid back Bunny rebels against the plans almost immediately, enjoying more spur of the moment pleasures (like an orgy in a train) and off the beaten track experiences.  After watching BUNNY score chicks on the train, the recently heart broken Stephen agrees to be more spontaneous, and the two wind up in Poland at a disgusting fast food restaurant, CAPTAIN CRAB, where Bunny, the compulsive gambler, livens the place by starting a crab race.  Bunny and Stephen befriend the waitress ELOISE who has just recently broke it off with her boyfriend and plans to return to her home in Spain.  Bunny and Stephen join her… making great haste in their departure after Bunny loses a bunch of money to some angry drunken locals. 

Bunny admits that he’s broke and needs them to head to his parents house in the alps. Much to Bunny’s surprise and chagrin, his father (uncle?)  MAX and Bunny’s siblings are all there, celebrating Max’s birthday.  Max warns Stephen that Bunny is nothing but a thief, and Bunny proves Max right… despite Stephen’s clear, growing feelings for ELOISA, Bunny sleeps with her. “You don’t mind do you?” and he steals MAX’s golden watch and a humongous stuffed bear.  Eloisa, Stephen and Bunny escape with the bear tied to the roof of their car. 

Eloisa explodes at them and forces them out.  Bunny, Stephen and the bear are lost and alone until they find a weird Viking with a fetish for dog fucking.  The Viking tries to get Stephen to marry one of his dogs, but Bunny wins their escape by swimming to a far off island and winning a bet.  Bunny is reinvigorated and realizes that, just as Max accuses, he’s been a “watcher’ rather than a “do-er” all his life.  He know wants to live the adventures, not just bet on them.  Eloisa returns and brings them to her home town in Spain where Bunny begins training to fight a bull.  Eloisa explains that she is no longer interested in Bunny, and Stephen tries to get together with her, but she gets upset, accusing Stephen of lying to her.  She decides to leave town and return to her studies in Norway. 

On the train home, Stephen takes it out on Bunny and accuses him of being a fraud.  Bunny stops the train, gets out and hops into a ring with a bull.  He performs an amazing bullfight, its so beautiful he winds up in tears.  Stephen, jealous hops into the ring hoping for the same exhilarating experience, but he is quickly gored by the bull.

He wakes up in the hospital and finds out from Max that Bunny got killed saving his life.  Back in his apartment, months after the incident, Stephen and “imaginary bunny” finally realize they must part ways.  Stephen decides to stop loafing around and plans to head to Norway to win back Eloisa.

Follow up to the action/adventure film, Largo Winch.

COMMENTS
This script is a fast paced, high-concept action with some great twists, turns and escapes, not to mention a couple of good surprises thrown in.  A total page- turner, quite smart and will likely be well done.  I totally enjoyed the read and imagine that this will do well in territories where the first one worked.

The film cuts back and forth between Asia and Europe with some great characters, traps, double-crossings and fight scenes.  Very creative in a James Bond way.  LARGO himself is trying to be a humanitarian and there is also another human-interest plot line which drives the story.

I highly recommend reading for any territory where a great action might work.  Film will be 65% English with the rest being a mix of Thai, French, etc.

SUMMARY
Following the murder of his adoptive father Nerio, Largo Winch is now CEO of the vast W Group. But the compromises money and power require don't suit Largo. He announces the sale of the Group and the creation of a humanitarian foundation, to be led by his father's oldest friend. 
  
The very day the agreement is signed; Largo is accused of complicity in crimes against humanity. International prosecutor Diane Franken suspects him of having paid off - four years previously, for his father's benefit - notorious Burmese General Kyaw Min, after the displacement of a mineral-rich native village on behalf of the W Group turned into a massacre. And she has a witness. 
  
The witness is no other than Malunaï, the beautiful Burmese villager with whom Largo had an intense love affair four years earlier. Stunned, he determines to discover who is forcing Malunaï to lie, and to solve the mystery of his father's role in the atrocity. When he learns that Malunaï has been deported and is now in the hands of the General, Largo's convinced she will be killed. He arrives in Burma with a highly dangerous plan and time running out. At Makiling Military Camp he will learn Malunaï's incredible secret. And discover that his enemies' plot is even more twisted than he imagined.

MIRJAM COMMENTS 
It's really a journey (road movie) where brothers and grandson learn about their (grand)father and each other along the way. A male-bonding story. Brothers with father. Uncle with nephew, father and son and two brothers.

Nice story. Not earth shattering, and its got a lot of talking, without much insight or progress to the story. It will have to be a mood piece with nice photography. The story is a bit thin, but the pay-off is nice. It remains a very small film. But with Walter Salles
at the helm and for a decent price, this is a must have for Cineart.

SM COMMENTS 
I pretty much agree with Mirjam; the writing is strong and poetic, particularly Octavio’s reflective monologues about nature and Fernando’s glowering angst, even Susan’s fraught melancholy was believable. It was slightly disappointing to me that the most interesting character in the script (PEDRO) never saw a moment of life on screen, and that device worked some times and felt like I was being cheated at other points… I agree it is good for Cineart; its an arthouse movie with a lot of emotion. 

SUMMARY 
Puerto Montt – Chile Chiloe Island

FERNANDO and his son CAIN fly into Chile and head to a small village; OCTAVIO, Fernando’s half brother (same father different mothers) is there already; the two sons have come to reconcile the estate of their deceased father. 

A local young woman, JIMENA, has cared for the body, shaving, cleaning him and dressing PEDRO in a nice suit. 

OCTAVIO discovers “the old man’s diaries.” More than fifty journals detail PEDRO’s life, mostly accounts of his sexual conquests and romances. Pedro may have died penniless, but he lived a life rich with women. His two sons, neither of whom had a significant relationship with him; have split reactions, OCTAVIO is fascinated by the journals and Fernando is completely disinterested. 

A woman calls and leaves a message on Pedro’s answering machine; it’s flirtatious and sexy and references a rendevous that Pedro will now surely miss… the sons are curious and begin asking around town without getting much information.   Octavio finds out that the woman was referred to as “the Argentinian.” 

They find out that Pedro had recently been hospitalized, possibly for self inflicted wounds. 

After the funeral, Jimena sleeps with Fernando; upsetting both Cain and the jealous Octavio. 

The three plan to fly home but the flights are delayed. Octavio decides to hunt for the woman; CAIN talks his father into following along.  During the journey, the two brothers quarrel, but also have moments of jocular fun and playful togetherness… like real brothers. 

Octavio finds out a name of her village in southern Argentina and the three go on a  long bus ride.  On the bus, both brothers read his journals and get to know their father better then they had during his actual time on earth. He talks about his life; his jobs, his women… Fernando is particularly affected by a passage about his birth. 

They find the town where “The Argentinian” is supposed to have lived. In the village they start searching for the woman based on descriptions from Pedro’s journals, and Octavio eventually tracks her down via the post office.  They find out that she’s managing a hotel in the small, southern town. They approach her, dumbfounded and silent; at a loss for words. Finally CAIN talks her into letting them have a room. When they tell her that they’re Pedro’s sons, she knows immediately that he has died. She  falls into mourning almost immediately. 

They find a beached whale and try to help it back into the sea; to no avail. 

Susan tells them that she had tried to commit suicide; and that she once had a husband and young son who died in a car accident.  They all get drunk and she opens up; “that fucking old man was everything to me, a lover, a father, a son, a friend.” 

Fernando admits that his wife wants to leave him, that he has trouble as a father, and that this trip has been “the best thing that has ever happened to him.” 

Their visit inspires Susan to leave, and presumably, get on with her life. Octavio plans to go back to Chiloe to try to start a relationship with Jimena; and Fernando and Cain set off on a journey… “as father and son at last.”

COMMENTS
Dense and literary, it is a little too long, but effectively transitions from a picaresque military adventure to a portrait of a career soldier driven by the events around him.  All the characters/historical figures are beautifully drawn and some smaller details/scenes really enhance the emotional value and meaning of the story (e.g., the roses, the shoot-up in the cinema, etc.)  Pancho Villa is a great character, very sympathetic– he is moved by the forces of history, unable to control events despite his efforts.  Feels like a history lesson, could be Che all over again.

SUMMARY
The day after the defeat of the dictator Diaz, PANCHO VILLA is in bed with a fever.  Attempting to marry his nurse, he is interrupted by minions of GENERAL HUERTA.  They arrest him but due to regulations cannot shoot him until he stands.  He remains seated in the face of their taunts until a directive arrives from FRANCISCO MADERO to spare his life and throw him in prison.  In prison, his intellectual cellmate gives him a copy of the Iliad and he escapes, aided by his brother URBINA.  He and his forces take Ciudad Juarez for MADERO, but he is then re-arrested by HUERTA.  HUERTA eventually has MADERO killed and URBINA breaks PANCHO VILLA out of prison yet again.

URBINA has planned a train robbery, but they find coal instead of the expected loads of gold.  With the help of a new recruit, violent station worker RUDY, PANCHO VILLA decides to use the train as a Trojan Horse and successfully takes out an enemy garrison.  URBINA terrorizes captured enemy officers and installs himself and his mother in a large mansion.

PANCHO VILLA leaves off from his attempts at gardening to attack Juarez, scaring off the American spectators across the river with a volley of bullets.  After attacking a second time so the Hollywood film directors can get their shot, PANCHO VILLA leads his forces to liberate a mine operation.  Not long after, he joins the command of FELIPE ANGELES and when GENERAL CARRANZA’s attempt to take Zacatecas fails, ANGELES and PANCHO VILLA’s succeeds.  ANGELES, a former aristocrat, is troubled by the brutality of the battle’s aftermath, but PANCHO VILLA remains stoic.

At a meeting with legendary revolutionary EMILIANO ZAPATA, PANCHO VILLA falls in love with twelve-toed JUANITA, who desires to kill him to revenge her family’s death.  HUERTA flees the country, and URBINA and RUDY urge PANCHO VILLA to take Mexico City before CARRANZA can but it is too late.  Several months later, they succeed and PANCHO VILLA becomes president of Mexico.  JUANITA runs away.

As president, PANCHO VILLA finds it hard to maintain the ideological purity of MADERO and eventually RUDY kills a particularly troublesome and fearless reporter.  PANCHO VILLA’s forces leave the capital to pursue CARRANZA, but while he is gone elements of CARRANZA’s army raze Mexico City and ZAPATA is killed through treachery.  PANCHO VILLA suffers a massive defeat and ANGELES dies.  URBINA betrays PANCHO VILLA and is shot and killed by RUDY.  After weeks of searching, PANCHO VILLA finds JUANITA and brings her with him to an American-backed defeat in Agua Prieta.  The constant warfare has taken its emotional toll, and after a final incursion into New Mexico to settle the score with the U.S., he takes his retirement.

In retirement, PANCHO VILLA tries to avoid politics and get JUANITA to fall in love with him.  JUANITA asks his leave to marry one of his guards and he reluctantly gives it.  At the wedding ceremony, she changes her mind, and PANCHO VILLA rushes to the church to take the groom’s place, but is gunned down and killed at the entrance by government members fearing a resurgence in PANCHO VILLA’s popularity.  His rose bushes finally blossom and smell beautifully.

A young Bosnian woman becomes a victim of the war when she is taken prisoner by soldiers and repeatedly raped in a female prison. The leader of the Soldiers falls for her and she draws the ire of the other prisoners for receiving special attention. 

COMMENTS

Well written script with very powerful subject matter.  If I’m not mistaken, this is actually highlighting the same topic as the movie STORM except that this one is from a first person perspective inside the female prison.  I don’t know the director or cast info, and that would play a part in the decision, but for the most part, I’d say instinctually I’d shy away from this type of film – do people want to see this sort of thing right now? It would have to be very well done and gain a lot of praise and awards to do good business I think.  Worth tracking, and please let me know the attachment info. 


SUMMARY 

A Bosnian young woman, SAMIRA moves to a small town to teach children who seem inured by the war;  “our teacher is not coming back.” SOLDIERS arrive in the town and rob a woman, taking her jewelry and wedding ring. SOLDIERS pour into the town and despite her protestations, SAMIRA is rounded up with the others. The men are taken away from the group and killed. 

SAMIRA is held captive with other Bosnian women, and they are repeatedly raped and abused by their captors.  SAMIRA is “asked out” by the CAPTAIN of the soldiers.  She spends the night with him, reveling in the food and fresh clean sheets on the bed, but is quickly sent back to her cell. The other women are jealous and angry.  SAMIRA is called back, and sleeps with him again, trying to help the other women by returning with food and some supplies, but they still call her a traitor.

Busses pull up to the camp and the other women are taken away, but Samira is separated from them.  The Captain gives her some crumpled bank notes and allows her to leave, joining the other women as they are rescued from the prison.  The bus drops the women off near a border and they think it’s a trap until more buses come to pick them up.  They are finally free. 

SAMIRA goes to a refugee shelter in Stockholm where she finds out that she is pregnant.  SAMIRA hallucinates spending time with her parents.  Samira wants to get rid of the baby. A Bosnian older woman tries to soothe her anger and pain; “he’s a survivor, just like you.” Reluctantly, SAMIRA decides not to abandon her child.

COMMENTS

The story builds very slowly and picks up momentum towards the end with a shocking climax and a creepy twist (the mother encouraged the murder) coming in the last ten pages.  Problematically, the characters aren’t developed well. The relationship between TC and YING is brief, their conversations very realistic, but lacking a certain quality – it’s a very existential script that seems too dry on the page. By the time the murders and shocking revelations come around, the script is over, not allowing the audience time to fully digest the tragic events on screen. Interesting, dark story that will be arthouse only, I don’t recommend for prebuy.

SUMMARY

TUCK CHAI, a young man in his early twenties, works in his families shop, lives with his mother (TC MOTHER) and passes the time by riding his beloved motorcycle and killing the rats that infest their home.

Ying’s father threatens to charge TC with statutory rape, and Ying’s mother gets so upset that she winds up punching TC in the face.  Ying’s parents forbid her from seeing TC again. They also blackmail TC and his mother, forcing them to ante up a bribe, or face criminal charges.  “They won’t press charges if we raise the money.” 

TC’s mother borrows money from a wealthy uncle and transfers it into Ying’s father’s account, but they double cross her and insist they will still press charges. After several unanswered phone calls, TC finally convinces Ying to see him.  Accompanied by WAN, Ying arrives at TC’s local hang out, where he is relaxing with his buddies MENG and KEAT.  TC and YING walk into the woods to speak alone.  After a brief argument, TC kills her, smashing her head with a stone.

World War 2 is over and Sergeant Skeen is ready to return home a victorious soldier, but before he can, he is ordered to defend the war criminal known as, the Beast of Battan. As Skeen is forced to question himself and his superiors, he discovers the inherent hypocrisies of war and the responsibilities of both sides.


COMMENTS

Beast of Battan is all story. What I mean by that is that it has the potential for critical acclaim, if done right. As it stands it’s an account of the trial of WW2 war criminal, General Masaharu Homma. Unfortunately, after 11 pages it became obvious that it’s a by the numbers trial feature. The characters are undeveloped and inconsistent (the hero is the least interesting and they all do things completely out of character). The dialogue is unimaginative and out of sync with the time period (heavy handed and the humor misses its mark). The first act drags and doesn’t really get going until half way through. Even with all of the flaws I still felt satisfied with the experience, just wish there had been more. I would only recommend this read for someone who’s willing to rework it.

SUMMARY

On the first night after the Japanese Emperor surrenders to the Allied forces, Skeen dances the night away at a Manila hotel. He tells one of his dance partners, Helen, of how he can’t wait to get back to his wife and newly born daughter. Everyone is in the throws of celebrating the end of a long, hard war.

As Skeen waits to board his transport ship home, he is summoned to the JAG. He reluctantly heads back into Manila. JAG orders Skeen to be in charge of defending the Beast of Battan. He knows that General Masaharu Homma is the war criminal charged with what is known as the Death March to Battan. He protests, arguing that he’s never even tried a case. He gets no more help than a promise that it will be a fast prosecution.

The Army gives Skeen a team of other poor excuses for lawyers. Coder is a hard-core patriot with no respect for anything Japanese. Furness is the oldest, most cynical and most experienced. Pelz is a womanizer as well as the comic relief. None of the group thinks that their client is innocent.

When the lawyers meet their client, they are talent off guard by his gravitas. Homma speaks good English and offers seats to the soldiers. They don’t accept. They explain their orders to defend him and give no words of encouragement. They have all been affected by the obvious humanity of Homma.

The team quickly discovers that they have divided into factions. Skeen and Coder are ready to railroad Homma through the system. Pelz and Furness, though not convinced of his innocents, want to give Homma the best defense possible. They point out that it’s their duty as Americans to treat Homma in accordance with US law. Coder thinks Homma deserves the same treatment as the Americans and Filipinos who were killed on the march. Coder is clearly the most blinded by emotions, so Skeen sends him to Tokyo to gather evidence and witnesses.

The case begins and it’s clear that everyone from General MacArthur on down wants Homma tried and executed as fast as appearances will allow. Pelz and Furness are the only ones who try to do things by the book. As witnesses and affidavits describing various atrocities that occurred while Hossa was in charge. Skeen sees Helen again and finds out that her husband was one of the men who died on the march.

In Tokyo, Coder befriends his Japanese assistant, and finds evidence that Hossa is not the one who gave the orders to kill and torture.

Outside of the courtroom Skeen starts a friendship with Hossa and is eventually convinced that he had nothing to do with the events that happened under his watch.

More condemning evidence is revealed. It seems that the entire world is against them.

The team builds a case, including witnesses and documentation, which proves that Hossa was unaware of what his subordinates were doing and therefore he isn’t responsible. The finale to there case is the testimony of Hossa’s elegant wife. In his closing statement, Skeen pleads with the judges to see that Hossa is an honorable man that just happened to be on the losing team. It all falls on deaf ears.

LOGLINE

A russian man is arrested by the secret police and interrogated as to the whereabouts of 'Buddha's Little Finger' an ultrapowerful weapon.  During the interrogation, the man blacks out and hallucinates that he's a hero during the Russian revolution.  After a while, he cannot remember which life is a dream.

COMMENTS

A dense, layered, emotional script that is not perfect, but certainly interesting and unique. I loved the way the story jumped back and forth between the critical points in Russian history, and loved the way the characters popped up in both storylines, blurring the line between the two worlds until the viewer was as confused as Pyotr.  The drug induced interrogation is a leaky conceit (was Pyotr narrating his dreams to Smirnov and TIMUROVNA?) but did not take away from my satisfaction with the story.  The dialog is strong, the characters vivid and the setting wonderful.  Definitely a tough film, (and I don’t like the title) which may not be a prebuy, but it’s worth reading and tracking.  CONSIDER.  

SUMMARY

1991 – A young man, PYOTR VOYD, runs from the Russian police during the coup that toppled the Soviet government.  KGB agents swarm him and shoot him in the neck with a dart.  He falls asleep and wakes up in:

1919 – Chekist soldiers grab and interrogate him.  Pyotr recognizes one of them, VORBLEI.  The soldier calls off the interrogation and brings Pyotr to his lush apartment for a drink.  Vorblei casually questions why Pyotr was running from authorities.  When Pyotr admits that he fired a shot at a Chekist soldier,  Vorblei tries to apprehend him.  Pyotr manages to kill Vorblei and is forced to hide the body and pretend to be Vorblei, when Chekist guards, ZHERBUNOV and BARBOLIN come knocking at the apartment door.    Pyotr and the guards snort some coke, “to the revolution!”

1991 - Pyotr wakes up in an interrogation chamber.  “Where is Buddha’s Little Finger?” Major Smirnov asks.  Pyotr has no idea what the man is talking about.   Pyotr fades back into sleep and wakes up in a cell with three gangsters, VOLODIN and his henchmen.  Volodin is surprised that Pyotr doesn’t remember anything, but warns Pyotr not to tell the interrogators anything.  ZHERBUNOV and BARBOLIN enter, now wearing white lab coats, and drag Pyotr back into the interrogation room.  The interrogators drug Pyotr and try to induce his memory to recall the information they are after.

1919 – Pyotr and the guards go to the “Musical Snuff Box,” where Pyotr sees, and instantly falls in love with, ANNA, who plays music on a theremin.  After her performance, a terrible play is staged.  Pyotr realizes that “Vorblei” is responsible for the play.  General CHAPAYEV keeps glancing over at their table, seemingly waiting for Pyotr/ Vorblei to do something to remedy the entertainment.  Pyotr/ Zherbunov and Barbolin interrupt the play and Pyotr recites some of his poetry as the guards fire shots into the air. “”I have no more words but my gun is fully loaded.”  His words are a rousing revolutionary ode, and the crowd, and Chaparov, are impressed.

1991 – “It appears that you prefer to exist within an elaborate fantasy of the Russian revolution than deal with your current circumstance.” The interrogator TIMUROVNA says, interrupting.  “This is the place that feels like a dream.”  Timurovna shows other interrogators electrocuting VOLODIN, and tells Pyotr he can save his buddy if he starts to talk.  “How can I help him?  I don’t even know who he is.”

The interrogators drug Pyotr again, and he finally remembers his current life.  He had been a penniless book merchant.  The gangster Volodin befriends and hires him to work in their gang.  Pyotr, Volodin and the others go on a drug binge in the woods and speak about spirituality and the ultimate high.  Volodin, who is normally surrounded by idiots, takes a liking to the intellectual Pyotr. “I remember them.  They are my friends.”

1919 – General CHAPAYEV comes over to Pyotr’s apartment and recruits Pyor to work in the political unit of the army.  Chapayev is a mysterious man, who seemingly possesses otherworldly powers.  He holds out a sword and shows it to Pyotr.  Rather than seeing his reflection, the face of the blade serves as a window into Lenin’s home, and Pyotr is flabbergasted.  Pyotr gives a speech at a train station that is a big hit. After the speech, Chapayev introduces Pyotr to ANNA, the theremin player who is also a revolutionary soldier.  

1990 – Pyotr realizes that Anna, a self proclaimed “revolutionary” against the Soviet government, is his lover. 

1919 – Anna has no interest in Pyotr and reprimands him for making advances.  Pyotr is devastated to find out that Anna has a lover, a fellow revolutionary soldier, KOTOVSKY.  FURMONOV, a soldier with a dislike for PYOTR tells him that they found a rotting corpse in his apartment (the dead Vorblei).  An explosion rips through the train.   Kotovsky kisses Anna and head off into battle.  Chapayev puts Pyotr in charge of one of the battalions.  Pyotr is nervous, but tries to impress Anna by rousing his troops “victory, that sultry whore, is wet and waiting just beyond those hills,” before fearlessly leading them into battle.

1991 – The interrogator’s urge Pyotr to recollect the last night before he was arrested.  He recalls VOLODIN telling him the story of Buddha Amagama, a man who could making his enemies disappear simply by pointing his little finger at them.  One day, the Buddha pointed at himself, and he disappeared, leaving only his little finger.  Volodin leads the gang on a job.  They break into Russian Baths.

Major SMIRNOV is getting impatient.  He needs Pyotr to tell them the location of Buddha’s little finger so they can destroy the uprising. 

1919 – Pyotr has gotten the medal of valor, but still cannot win the heart of ANNA.  

1990 – Pyotr recalls having a gunfight with the KGB and realizes that he’s accidentally killed her.

1919 – Pyotr wants to stay in this life, he wants to be the revolutionary hero rather than the poet/ gangster who has killed his lover.  Kotovsky abandons Anna, so she finally succumbs to Pyotr’s advances.    Furmonov tells him that they identified the rotting body, and that Pyotr will be hanged.  The opposition forces attack and burn the manor (in which the revolutionaries have been living.)  Pyotr tries to save Chapayev and get him to leave the burning home, but Chapayev talks spiritually about the nature of life and dreams. “You cannot escape your nature by leaping between lives.”  He leads Pyotr through both his lives in a series of hallucinatory journeys that wind up with Chapayev, Pyotr and Anna fleeing their enemies in an armored car.  Chapayev points the little finger at the enemies and they all instantly disappear.  Chapayev and Anna walk into a river and drift away.  Pyotr follows. 

1991 – The interrogators believe that Pyotr has died.  They are overrun by rebels who have toppled the soviet government.  Pyotr wakes and unstraps himself, walking outside in his hospital gown.  “I just escaped from the KGB.”

LOGLINE

Psychological horror story about a young woman accused of being possessed and burnt alive in an exorcism.


COMMENTS

This Irish tale for me was an interesting one however, I felt it took way too long to get to the action.  There are a few story lines that are not followed through completely – Bridget works for and befriends an unpopular, wealthy couple in secret – the husband is absolutely in love with her.  Johanna’s mystery husband is never discussed – there is a throw-away line from Bridget’s mom asking how far gone she is – two months – and maybe one other reference.  Aside from these, the writing is good but I don’t see the story really traveling.  Neither actor cast in the lead is pre-sellable and this is not something that seems like an obvious pre-buy to me.  Wait and track only.


SUMMARY

Bridget Cleary is a beautiful, independent, head-strong Irish woman living in the country.  She marries handsome and strapping Michael and returns to her village.  Her family reveres her and is very proud of the mate she has selected.  The whole town is a bit superstitious about fairies which they feel inhabit and possess people, robbing their spirits.  Bridget and Michael come across a charming abandoned cottage and decide to move in despite the fact that they are warned that it is haunted by fairies and left abandoned because the previous owners were scared off.  It is very close to a thick, overgrown woods area known as fairy fort. Michael seems reluctant at first though head-strong Bridget doesn’t believe in any of that mumbo jumbo.  Bridget’s superstitious, limping old Uncle Jack warns them not to live there.  When they move in, Uncle Jack insists on measuring both Michael and Bridget in the house because if the fairies come and “take possession of ye, yer measure will change”.  Bridget resists but allows herself to be finally be measured.
 
Bridget is an excellent seamstress and dressmaker.  Her earnings not only support her and Michael, but she also helps her now-widowed father.  As Bridget becomes more successful and more aware of the higher fashion in the big cities, her attitude changes a bit as well.  Since her marriage, she and Michael have been trying to have a child.  Bridget does not become pregnant and her Uncle Jack claims that as long as they are living in the fairy house, she will never conceive.  This infuriates Michael.  As time goes on and Bridget falls more into her own work groove, Michael starts feeling neglected and worried that people are talking about the fact that his wife does as she pleases and hasn’t given him a child.  A big fight ensues with Michael slapping Bridget – she cannot get over this and finally decides to leave, pretending to be away all day making deliveries.  She runs into a horrible rain storm, becoming drenched to the bone and sick with fever.  When she is taken back to the cottage to be tended to, her aunt and cousin Johanna, close to her age with a child and a husband who never returned, it is apparent that Bridget was running away – wearing 3 layers of clothes and with money tucked into her stockings.
 
Michael is weeping over the state of his wife and in a stupor babbles to Johanna that it isn’t right that a wife treat his husband that way, that she is not a wife to him and doesn’t do wifely duties – with this he pulls Johanna to him, they sleep together and he asks her to go off to NY with him – she is delighted and shows him the money that Bridget was hiding in her stockings.
 
Bridget wakes with fever, has been diagnosed with bronchitis and a priest is sent in to help “exorcise” her.  At this point Uncle Jack hobbles in and insists that they measure Bridget – he is convinced that the fairies have possessed her.  He takes a length of her sewing ribbon and finds that Bridget in the bed is two inches longer than the Bridget measured on the wall when they moved into the cottage.  Michael goes crazy with rage, goes to a man who can help “get Bridget back” using special herbs that will drive the fairies away.  While Michael is close to fairy fort, he finds Bridget’s feathered hat and a train schedule underneath for Dublin.  A whole sort of horrid exorcism takes place where Bridget is force fed herbs, urine is thrown on her and her face is burned with a fire poker.  When she comes to Michael and Uncle Jack shout at her – “who are you”, “are you Bridget Cleary, wife of Michael Cleary”.  She finally says yes.  They think she is cured and on her way back to health. 
 
The next morning, she dresses with the intent to run away again.  She tells Michael that she is not his wife, that she wants to go and live her childless life alone and he should leave he be – there is a struggle, a tussle.  He strikes her and again chases her with a fire poker.  The entire family has gathered and watched the macabre scene unfolding around them where Michael persecutes, chases and beats Bridget then in a fit of rage, finally sets her on fire.
 
Michael and most of the family, Johanna especially, claim that she has run off and no one knows where she is.  After an investigation, the local police find a rigor-mortis figure huddled up, hands to face in protection, burned beyond recognition.  They exhume the body and discover that it is in fact Bridget.  Michael is imprisoned and Bridget’s own brothers actually serve time as well as accessories.

LOGLINE
Sophia’s only pleasure in life is escaping from her emotionally abusive mother to write poems and stories in her diary.  When a big-shot publisher drives into town, Sophia has to overcome her past and her mother in order to find a new meaning in life– and possibly love.

COMMENTS
Short, and somewhat bland and predictable, Finding Sophia has some good moments, but also some clunky scenes and contrived plotting.  The character of the mother is clearly the evil villain from the beginning, and the reasons revealed for her murdering her youngest daughter are shallow at best.  Most of the characters are also unfortunately shallow: the provincial nosy neighbors, the kindly old café owner, the impossibly rich and kind outsider Prince Charming– and Sophia, the emotionally stunted French girl with hidden reserves of charm and beauty.  Not enough on offer.  Pass.

SUMMARY
30-year-old SOPHIA BRIAND works in her mother’s gift shop and is treated miserably by her mother, ANNA.  She enjoys sneaking away to write in her diary, but ANNA punishes her and constantly blames her for the death of her little sister when she was 6.  SOPHIA’s father, GUSTAV, is sympathetic, but cannot stand up to ANNA.  SOPHIA sneaks out of her room to sit at the village café and write.  The friendly old waiter, MAURICE, talks to SOPHIA and encourages her.

STEPHANE MASSON, a big-shot in the publishing world, drives his Mercedes into the small town and stops at the café.  After prodding from MAURICE, STEPHANE recounts his reason for coming.  When he was a young reader of author submissions about 20 years before, his company received remarkable letters from a young girl, SOPHIA BRIAND.  He drove down from Paris to offer her an unprecedented deal, but her mother informed him that she had passed away, asking him to leave.  Over the years he has become increasingly attached to and moved by the young girl’s writing, and is making a pilgrimage to her grave.  SOPHIA overhears this story while she sits in the café but is too nervous, emotionally battered, and embarrassed of her ragged appearance to speak out to the urbane STEPHANE.  STEPHANE heads off to the graveyard, and MAURICE goes into a flurry of activity, purchasing a dress for SOPHIA and having his wife VALERIE cut SOPHIA’s hair and apply makeup.

ANNA learns of the stranger in town and SOPHIA’s transformation and hurries to the café.  She attempts to intimidate and verbally batter SOPHIA into returning home but with MAURICE, VALERIE and GUSTAV’s support SOPHIA resists.  SOPHIA demands to know why ANNA had told STEPHANE that she was dead years ago.  ANNA is desperate, and SOPHIA begins to recall memories that she had repressed for years.  We see her flash back to the time of her sister’s death and learn that drunken ANNA locked SIMONE, SOPHIA’s sister, outside in the winter as some sort of punishment.  ANNA tries to deny this, but SIMONE remembers writing letters to a publishing house, some of which ANNA managed to destroy, some which got through.  ANNA attempts to throw SOPHIA’s diary in the fireplace.  During this conversation, VALERIE has brought the town’s police officer to listen at the door, and he leaves to get the letters from STEPHANE.  When the officer returns, he reveals that in one of the letters is a life insurance policy receipt that had been taken out days before SIMONE’s death.  By now it is clear that ANNA murdered SIMONE and she is taken into custody.  STEPHANE returns to the café, and after some gentle coaxing, gets SIMONE to open up to him.  It is clear that STEPHANE has loved her through her writing for years, and she quickly begins to fall for him.  GUSTAV hears SOPHIA laughing and walks back home, happy that his daughter can finally move on.

An American civilian drives convoy trucks in Iraq, and dangerous job that pays more, but tears apart his family and nearly gets him killed.

COMMENTS MW
Remember this project? It used to be with Warner Independent, but the producers (Cherry Road Films) got it back after WI folded. They now have Liev Schreiber attached and I just took another look. Joshua Marston is still directing (Maria Full of Grace).

I just don't see this as the next 'Hurt Locker'. Iraq war movie, but yet I don't feel the characters as I did in the Hurtlocker, therefore it will be an uphill battle type of project. the story just doesn't get moving and it is hard to root for anybody. The script is actually pretty depressing and repetitive. What do you think? Shall we pass for now? 

COMMENTS
 A well written story that has the potential to be very moving.  The plot rambles slowly in the beginning, and I found myself wondering where the story was going to take me, but I never lost interest.  By the time Jim gets stranded in the desert, we have grown close to him, and this closeness makes the tense situations even more harrowing. The details of this script are wonderful, giving an incredibly fascinating account  of the methods and tactics used to convoy gas tankers through the dangerous territory. The writing is very visual, the writer managing to almost depict the film shot for shot in the reader’s mind.  The characters are all very real, and never fell into the trap of making the Arabs (or Americans for that matter) fall into stereotypes.  Good project, my only hesitation being that it may be a touch too slow at times.
 
SUMMARY
 JIM (call sign HOUND DOG) drives as an escort for tanker trucks in Iraqi convoys that transport fuel.  The convoys are accompanied by armed US military Humvees, but Jim and his fellow civilian truckers are not armed and are often in danger of being shot or killed.

During a routine run, Jim spots an Iraqi driving dangerously close to the convoy and runs it off the road.   During the next run, an IED destroys on of the trucks, and nearly kills MIKE, a fellow driver.   Jim and Kenny pull Mike out of his truck and wait for the medevac to bring their pall to safety, despite the fact that their heroism put their own lives at risk. 

 Jim and Kenny both go on R & R.  Jim returns home to Illinois to visit his family.  His wife and his daughter are at each other’s throats and Jim doesn’t get a moments peace.  He is almost relieved to get back to Iraq. 

Upon returning, Jim finds that he has to go on a convoy with an inexperienced leader, call sign STAR GAZER.  The trip goes awry and Star Gazer’s truck explodes.  Jim’s truck gets  split of from the rest of the convoy and Jim realizes that his truck is on fire.  He gets out of the truck shortly before it explodes. 

Jim is stranded in the middle of Iraq, exposed, and definitely in danger.  A pair of young Iraqis, ZAHRA and RAEDE, bring Jim to a shop where their uncle AHMED works.  Jim cannot communicate with the man, and before he knows it, he’s being driven around in a car by three Iraqis, one of whom is carrying an AK 47 assault rifle. 

Jim is taken to Zahra’s uncle AHMED’s house and spends the night.  Zahra acts as the translator as the men argue.  Jim wants a ride to a US base 45 miles away, but the Iraqis insist they will drive him in the morning.  A group of armed me invade the house, and Jim is sure he is going to be killed, but he hides in a shed out back and no one is harmed. 

In the morning the men are true to their word and begin to drive Jim to the base.  Along the way a US convoy of humvees shoot out their tire and Jim is stranded again.  His escort gets into a fight with a bearded Iraqi, and AHMED and his buddies are arrested by Iraqi police.  Jim tries to explain that Ahmed was helping him.  Jim gets a hold of a US army officer who dispatches a team to pick him up.   The bearded Iraqi invades the police station, kills the two cops, kills AHMED, and tries to kidnap Jim and TARIQ (Ahmed’s son).  The US troops pull up and kill the rebel Iraqis.  Jim is saved.

An aging writer falls for his daughter’s best friend and starts an affair; his daughter falls in love with a social climbing Australian magazine publisher, and the writer’s nephew comes to live with them in NYC. 
 
COMMENTS 
The writing is strong; the characters have the NYC literati flaire in the best sense; like characters from Woody Allen films;  as in all of Baumbauch’s movies, they are all quite self involved, but this film has a light touch throughout, and also has a strong plot which keeps the story moving. It’s sexy, fun at times, and poignant at others. My only negative note is that I didn’t really like the 9-11 themed ending; as soon as I realized that’s how they were gonna wrap it up, I got a negative taste in my mouth, and think the end was the only disappointment. Still, fun read, very interesting project and it will definitely be the type of arthouse pic that gets some attention; role is particularly great for Bana who’s quite underrated. 

Mirjam's Comments: I read the script and I like it. It's a bit high brow in the Noah Baumbach kind of way, but I am convinced this is NOT The Squid and the Whale. It is far more commercial then that. The characters are all older than 23 is one reason. Also, at a budget of around 10 million dollar it is very do-able. 

The script reminds me of the project based on John Irvin's novel 'A Widow for One Year'. That novel was made into a movie (Door in the Floor - Focus was selling it at the time), but failed to live up to it's potential. 
Please read this as soon as you can. They still have Keira Knightly, Eric Bana and Richard Gere. We can pick our own 'Danielle' - the big breasted one - please give us your faves!  Let me know what you think. The worst case scenario: you will have read a well written screenplay, which is a treat at this point...

 
 
SUMMARY 
 MURRAY is a wise old writer; when he speaks, lecture halls get packed to the brim. We see him lecture at Columbia, and go out to drinks with a professor ELI; and a COLLEGE GIRL, ROANNE, who claims to be interested in an interview, but also seems interested in getting a little bit more. Sex. But Murray is a loyal family man and heads home to his wife ANNABEL and daughter MARINA. They have a wonderful dinner, joined by 30 something DANIELLE who admires the family’s warmth and humor.  MURRAY seems interested in Danielle; and Danielle notices it. Murray gets Danielle’s email address from Marina. 
 
DANIELLE and MARINA run into an old fried; CINDY, who is out with LUDOVIC; an Australian publisher. He asks Danielle about her documentaries; “I’m really just a cog…” They exchange info. 
 
MURRAY’s troubled nephew BOOTIE, an 18 year old budding intellectual/ college dropout leaves his house without telling his concerned mother and heads to Manhattan, where he drops in, unannounced, at Murray’s.   Marina is not excited to have him around; 
 
The first night he is there, their elderly cat dies. “It’s not your fault.”  Murray finds out that Bootie has lied to his mother about his whereabouts; Bootie explains that she doesn’t understand him.  Murray agrees to let Bootie work as his “assistant,” and “fires” Marina from the job. She is livid, despite the fact that she didn’t like the job and was terrible at it anyway. 
 
Murray takes Danielle out for a drink, ostensibly to discuss how they’re both worried about Marina. Their flirtation grows. 
 
Murray gets an award at the Waldorf; Danielle and Marina join him, and Danielle brings the sexy Ludovic as her date. Meanwhile, at home, Bootie opens Murray’s safe and begins reading his secret manuscript. 
 
Ludovic gets Marina a job, and the two wind up sleeping together.  Murray and Danielle consummate their relationship one night while Annabel is out of town. 
 
Bootie secretly makes a Xerox copy of Murray’s manuscript. 
 
Marina and Ludovic decide to get married; Murray takes the news in stride, seemingly nonplussed. “Be careful it doesn’t look like a pr stunt.” 
 
Murray gets bad news from his publisher; his advance will likely be cut or not proffered at all; Murray reads Marina’s book and tells her that he doesn’t like it; in a fairly condescending fashion.  “There’s a lot of great stuff in there!” 
 
Bootie turns on Murray; seemingly the negative feelings stemming from reading Murray’s manuscript and deeming it a load of bullshit; Bootie starts writing a really negative article about him.  Bootie also finds out about Murray’s affair with Danielle. 
 
Bootie sends copies of the scathing article; which reads like a review of Murray’s unpublished book; to his mother, to Ludovic, to Marina and to Murray himself.  Marina is livid; Ludovic loves it and wants to publish it in his new magazine; Murray throws Bootie out.
 
Marina and Ludovic prepare for the wedding; Ludovic seems a bit too eager for the press associated with marrying Marina.  Murray gets worried that Ludovic is going to print the article. 
 
Bootie starts temping for financial firms.  After the wedding, Ludovic and Marina ramp up preparations for the magazine’s September launch and marina gets upset when she finds out that Ludovic is planning to run the article. 
 
Murray lies to his wife and spends the night of September 10th 2001 at Danielle’s house. They wake up to chaos.  Ludovic watches the twin towers burning on CNN and realizes that his magazine is doomed.  Murray rushes out of Danielle’s apartment, trying to conduct a lie about his whereabouts. 
 
The family finds out that Bootie has died on 9-11. 
 
Ludovic heads for London, abandoning Marina. “You’re the shit my father said you were.” 
 
Bootie, it turns out, didn’t die at all; he got on a bus to Miami and disappeared. 
 
Marina doesn’t seem devastated about the breakup, clearly more well adjusted now. She and Danielle reconnect and promise to never fade out of each other’s lives again.  Danielle nearly confesses, but stops short. 
 
Murray returns to teaching; Marina’s book hits the best seller list.

A retired spy; LOGAN, is dragged back into the life he’s abandoned when he realizes that he’s been used as a tool for the CIA, against his will. He and his 15 year old daughter go on the run to escape being murdered by government sponsored hit men. 
 
COMMENTS:
Could use a bit of a trim towards the end, and some of the writing is clunky, but it’s a good popcorn project; similar to TAKEN in certain respects.  The corporate espionage angle is really the only major drawback, the script spends far too much time delving into the fairly mundane aspects of HUDSON GROUP’s corrupt activities; like the film is trying to be both MICHAEL CLAYTON & BOURNE IDENTITY. I haven’t seen the director’s work, but I hear that he’s really good; so pending A List cast, this could definitely be a project of interest, especially if its possible to get involved early. Recommend for popcorn territories; B plus list. 
 
SYNOPSIS:
GERMANY 
LOGAN is a securities expert who finds flaws in some of the work of his company; HUDSON GROUP.  He is frustrated that when he reports it his superiors, they all seem to ignore him. 
 
At home, Logan is trying his best to live with his 15 year old daughter; AMY. She’s never lived with him before, but after the death of her mother, she moved to Europe… but the two are practically strangers.  One night after he is forced to stay late at work, he tracks his daughter down at a political protest; with her boyfriend, NAVID.    
 
The next morning Logan goes to work early, but the entire place is cleaned out entirely- no desks, furniture; nothing.  With Amy unhappily along for the ride, Logan heads to Frankfurt, to meet with his boss; KOHLER; but the Hudson Group has no records of Kohler as an employee, or of Logan or of anyone in their group.  
 
FLOYD, Logan’s assistant, finds him and attacks him; he’s an assassin, and he tries to kill both Logan and Amy. Logan gets the upper hand and kills the young hit man… Amy is terrified; she’s never seen her father get violent.  Logan finds a locker that belonged to Floyd, containing a locker a dossier about him; FLOYD had done a complete surveillance on him, Amy, and the others in the office.  Logan starts digging to find out what is going on.  Amy wants to go to the police, but Logan insists they go on the run. 
 
LOGAN talks and bribes his way into the morgue where he finds he bodies of all of his work colleagues on slabs;  AMY is terrified. 
 
LOGAN realizes that one colleague is not dead; “DWIGHT’S not here.” Dwight turns out to be an assassin, presumably in league with Floyd. Dwight opens fire on Logan and Amy. 
 
AMY is shocked by her father’s incredible array of skills; he kills DWIGHT using expert hand to hand combat skills; and they escape from authorities in a hospital by climbing out the window like rock climbers; then he hot wires a car and they speed away.  Logan reluctantly admits to her that he’s a retired spy.
 
Back in Langley, CIA AGENT BRENDA POWELL is charged with bringing “BEN” back in. “It’s no secret you knew him intimately.” Powell calls Kohler, who tells her that they got a “code red” and that “everybody’s dead.” Kohler tells her that someone cut her out of the loop.  Kohler tells her that he secured the object of the mission but wont hand it over until he gets paid.  Powell talks to RHODES, her boss; who admits that they had been on a mission with the german secret service investigating the HUDSON GROUP, a large American corporation, but that the evidence has been robbed out of their safehouse. 
 
POWELL leads investigators on a raid of Logan’s house; Logan and Amy go on the run; a friend of her helps sneak them to a secret safehouse.  They begin investigating the shell company, trying to get to the bottom of the situation. 
 
The Hudson Group’s head lawyer, RUBENSTEIN, negotiations with the Rwandan woman spearheading the class-action lawsuit; he offers her a deal; 50 million dollars in order to free Hudson from responsibility for the gasoline spill. 
 
Meanwhile, the agency sends their top killer, MAITLAND, after Logan. 
 
Logan finds Kohler’s suite number at a hotel and gets the jump on him; beating him mercilessly and asking who set up the front operation; Kohler pulls Logan’s gun to his head and kills himself; AMY is traumatized when she sees the violence and death. 
 
Powell and several other CIA ops are in the hotel and they open fire on Logan and Amy as they try to escape; Powell and Logan square off; she begs him to come back, claiming she can protect him. He escapes with AMY, managing to hold onto the ipod and digital security device which inciting the entire rogue mission… but AMY is livid; she accuses her father of being a liar, and a killer and runs off on her own. 
 
MAITLAND catches her and kidnaps her. LOGAN teams up with NAVID; her boyfriend, to track her and save her. “would you die for her?” 
 
Logan finds out that Powell and the Hudson group are linked in the conspiracy;  
 
Hudson double crosses Powell and gets Maitland to kill her.  Logan brings the evidence to Hudson, who lets Amy go (planning to kill her later) but Logan has planted a bomb in the briefcase; as they drive away, Hudson, Maitland, Rubenstein and other bad guys blow up. Logan finds Amy and the two prepare to head back to the U.S.

COMMENTS
Middle East should immediately try to buy this unless it’s already gone.  It’s a bit trickier for the rest of the clients; it’s a popcorn movie, a gangster movie with action, and IF Tony Scott and the cast are all confirmed it’s worth a gamble.  The prices are sure to be high, but it’s very interesting to see Hackman attached (I’ve heard he’s retired) and the other cast is exceptional as well;  Scott has a knack for making exciting films; and this really is a Hollywood type film with a European setting, which could make it interesting for others.  On the whole, the script is perhaps too long, but it reads quickly and there’s quite a bit of excitement; it’s got the rat- a-tat dialog of a watered down scorcese or tarantino, though not as artfully done.  The two main characters, and indeed POPPO as well all have a lot of soul, which helped elevate this past standard fare. I enjoyed it. Consider.


SUMMARY
ACT I: TONY and HARDY, two dead killers buried deep in the concrete foundation of a new building, recall their lives of crime. Tony tells the story of PATRICIA, the kept woman of a crime boss, and VIKTOR, her lover one of the boss’s employees.


Viktor meets the beautiful Patricia with a suitcase full of $5 million in stolen money. They tear each others’ clothes off and fall onto the bed. The crime boss, POPPO, receives the news of Patricia’s affair from another of his henchmen, CHARLIE. Poppo rushes to catch the lovers and kill them himself, but they escape on a plane.


Six years later gangster GOIN’ BALD BOB tells Tony that Poppo wants Tony to go to Germany. Poppo has a business venture there that is threatened by a rival businessman who happens to be Viktor. Goin’  
Bald Bob instructs Tony to take Hardy with him to carry out a hit on two of Viktor’s men. And Bob insists they must kill everyone present in the room when doing the job.


ACT II: Hardy, loud and boisterous with a facial tick, flies to Germany with Tony, whose quiet and collected demeanor could not be more different from his partner. Once in Germany Tony and Hardy acquire guns from VITA, their Turkish driver. Vita delivers them to PREMIG, their contact and a former East German police officer. Premig shows the hitmen to an apartment building where they will carry out their job. Premig rings the bell for Apartment 14, and the front door opens. A WOMAN emerges from Apartment 14 and passes Tony and Hardy in the hall.


Hardy kicks the door in on Unit 16 and easily kills three men with Tony. Then, the door to an adjacent room opens, and TIGER TIM, a massive man with a tiger stripe painted face and a gold watch, approaches them. After a brutal fight Tony and Hardy manage to strangle Tim. In the next room they find a six-year-old GIRL hiding in a closet. Hardy insists they must kill the girl, but Tony cannot watch. He exits the building and wretches on the street. Tony gets a cigarette from the woman they saw in the hallway. Hardy rushes out of the building and hurries Tony to Vita’s car.


Neither man can sleep that night at the hotel ‘ Hardy because he wants to hit the town and Tony because of his remorse for killing the girl. Hardy prefers not to talk about it, but Tony wants the details of the kill.


Poppo calls the next morning as Hardy and Tony prepare to catch their flight home. Poppo tells them they need to stay because there will be trouble since they have killed Viktor and Patricia’s daughter. Poppo plans to fly into Germany the following day. The boss hangs up leaving Hardy irate. Hardy insists they should have been told this was a personal hit and not for business. Hardy feels it is very bad business to stay in the same place after the job has been finished.


Tony and Hardy along with four other gangsters, FLORIDA BOB, DONNY, MICKY, and BENNY, wait for Poppo at the airport. POPPO arrives with Goin’ Bald Bob and SAL, a sharply dressed additional henchman.


Later that night, all of the gangsters save for Poppo and Goin’ Bald Bob have a drink at the hotel bar. Tony grows tired of the inane conversation and leaves by himself. He meets Goin’ Bald Bob who admits Poppo should have told Tony and Hardy about the girl. Goin’  
Bald Bob claims killing her could have been a mistake for business, but they must do as Poppo asks. Tony runs into Poppo in the hallway.  
Poppo gives Tony a meaningless thank you, and they meet the others at the hotel bar.


Over the next few days and nights the gangsters drive around and through the massive Potsdamer Platz construction site, the business venture that initially brought Poppo’s interests to Germany. They finally stop at the site, which is in a general state of disarray with bombed cabins and tipped over cranes. Poppo meets YOSSARIO, Vita’s father. Poppo addresses his men and Yossario from the roof of his car about his desire for vengeance on Viktor and the profitability of this enterprise.


The gangsters and members of Yossario’s group get together for coffee. Tony and Hardy meet HEINRICH, a German contractor who subcontracted Potsdamer Platz to Yossario. Heinrich addresses Hardy’s facial tick, but Hardy remains calm even as he smolders inside. Next, Heinrich turns to Tony who is seething over the German’s treatment of Hardy, but Poppo interrupts before Tony has a chance to speak. Poppo asks Hardy to go to the hotel and pick up a gift for Yossario. Hardy leaves with Vita, and Poppo breaks into an absurd dance of celebration as Tony’s mind returns to the murdered little girl.


On the way to the hotel Vita tells Hardy that Heinrich put Yossario in touch with Poppo. Hardy retrieves the gift but grows concerned when he notices a glance from two BUSINESSMEN in the hallway. He returns to Poppo’s room and waits for several minutes until he hears a knock at the door. Hardy asks who it is but gets no reply. He calls the front desk to bring up room service and requests they knock four times. Room service knocks appropriately, and Hardy walks to the elevator after seeing the hall is empty. As Hardy waits for the elevator the two businessmen reappear and a gun battle ensues. Hardy trips over Poppo’s bag and loses his gun while falling down the stairs.


Nearly unconscious, a cartoon Poppo screams profanity laced encouragement in Hardy’s mind. In mid-fall, Hardy snatches the gun from the air and fires two perfect shots, killing both of his attackers. Outside Hardy finds the car’s window smashed in and no sign of Vita. Hardy patches his wounds at the safe house while the other gangsters debate whether they are in Germany because of business, Viktor, or Patricia.


Goin’ Bald Bob calls Tony and Hardy into another room for questioning about the earlier hit. Heinrich says Viktor insists his daughter was kidnapped, not killed, and he is holding Vita for ransom. Hardy vehemently insists they killed the girl. Yossario sorrows over his son, but Poppo has no sympathy for him since Yossario knew the risks.  
Yossario insists he never wanted anyone’s children to be killed.  
Heinrich and Goin’ Bald Bob concern themselves only with planning strategy. Poppo plans another assault on Viktor against the wishes of Heinrich and Goin’ Bald Bob who prefer wait.


The assault commences. Donny and Micky kill two men and kidnap DORFMEISTER, an accountant. Florida Bob fires rockets at an office block. Sal tries to kill five Russian and East German HEAVIES. They turn the tables on Sal and pepper his car with bullets. Hardy and Tony sit in a dark room waiting for a lawyer, and Hardy confesses that he did not kill the girl. ALEXANDER FRINKA, the lawyer, enters, and Tony kills him. Immediately after the kill Tony unleashes a tirade against Hardy for not killing the girl. At first, they both think they have no hope to avoid Poppo’s wrath, but Tony seems to get an idea.


Hardy tells Tony they should run away over drinks. Tony gazes at a woman smoking a cigarette while Hardy talks. They both agree finding the girl would be better than escaping, but Hardy doubts their ability to do that. Tony sends Hardy home with Premig. Hardy notices Tiger Tim’s watch on Premig’s wrist.


Hardy meets the other gangsters and the terrified Dorfmeister at the safe house. Hardy tells Poppo that Tony left ‘to get laid,’ which angers Poppo. Tony returns to the apartment building where they carried out the hit. He kicks in the door to Apartment 14 and confronts the woman from the hallway who gave him a cigarette. She tells Tony her name is Monica, and she did that job without knowing what it involved because she needed money. Monica remembers seeing the girl carried out and the bodies from the hit. Tony tells her he must find the girl.


Tony observes cars pulling up and four MEN getting out. He and Monica attempt to escape. Four more MEN enter through the roof. Tony and Monica get out through a window and run away just as gun fire rains down around them from the men above. Monica tries to get away from Tony, but more shots are fired at her. Tony saves her again, and he and Monica hide in a park.


Later, Tony takes Monica with him to meet privately with Yossario.  
Tony tells Yossario that the older man must trust him. Tony tries to sneak back into the safe house, but all of the other hitmen hear him come in. They only want to know about the girl Hardy said he was with and to make fun of Sal for getting shot up. Tony dreams of bursting through the ground gasping for air as if he was buried alive. He awakens with Poppo standing over him and instructing him not to wander off by himself again. After Poppo leaves Tony recalls making love with Monica in the park.


The next morning Poppo replaces all the Russian workers at Potsdamer Platz with Turks. The old crime boss speaks of his youth and the way Patricia made him feel. Heinrich tells Poppo there has been a delay, and the final paper signing must wait until tomorrow. Poppo plans to hold a celebration tonight and sign the papers following morning. He leaves and takes Tony and Hardy with him. In the car he speaks of treachery and expects additional delays from Heinrich.


Poppo, Tony, and Hardy go to McDonald’s where they meet PORNO PETE and SHARKEY, two more gangsters Poppo has kept hidden in the city for weeks. Porno Pete and Sharkey show Poppo evidence of betrayal, and the offender is Goin’ Bald Bob. Tony and Hardy draw the assignment of killing Goin’ Bald Bob.


Tony and Hardy scheme together in the bathroom during the celebration that night. Hardy worries about their chances for success, but Tony insists working with Yossario to find the girl is their best shot.  
They rejoin the party where Heinrich tells them of his belief that Poppo’s way of doing business is obsolete and no longer useful.  
Patricia enters the party and begs for the life of her daughter, Jasmine. Poppo claims to have killed her himself. As Goin’ Bald Bob ushers Patricia away she claims to have spoken with Jasmine that morning, which catches Poppo’s attention. Poppo realizes he has been lied to, but Tony and Hardy have already snuck out.


ACT III: Tony and Hardy flee. Hardy insists they go to the airport, but Tony wants to save the girl. Tony gets help from Yossario to transport Monica to the United States where she can live safely and comfortably with the money Tony has stashed away. Hardy and Tony, now riding together in a car, discuss the strange sensation each feels now that they are doing something good. They arrive at the building where Jasmine is hidden away.


Premig returns home and finds Jasmine is missing. He visits Heinrich and confesses to kidnapping Jasmine after Tony and Hardy failed to kill her. Heinrich takes the news gracefully but unexpectedly snaps into a fit of rage and stabs Premig to death with a paintbrush.


Poppo takes a shower, and Benny enters the bathroom to tell him someone has arrived. Poppo leaves the bathroom and enters a hotel suite where the gangsters wait with the just arrived Goin’ Bald Bob.  
Goin’ Bald Bob speaks with complete nonchalance and assures Poppo they will find Tony and Hardy. This message meets utter coldness from all of the others in the room. Poppo points out Heinrich’s body, which is there with them. The boss confronts Goin’ Bald Bob with his belief Heinrich and Goin’ Bald Bob were hatching a plan together.  
Poppo takes Donny’s gun and shoots Goin’ Bald Bob.


Tony, Hardy, and Monica wait with Jasmine in a café. Viktor arrives, and Jasmine runs to him. The two leave together and Vita is released.  
Heinrich, still alive at this point, meets them in the café and offers his help. Hardy and Tony discuss working for Heinrich, Goin’  
Bald Bob, and Viktor in the back of Heinrich’s car. They discuss the next step of killing Poppo when bullets crack through the windshield, killing Heinrich and sending the car rolling over and over down the street. Sharkey and Porno Pete stroll up to the destroyed vehicle.


The gangsters make small talk over the battered bodies of Tony and Hardy. Poppo arrives, and Hardy fires verbal barbs at him and several of the others. Tony remains calm. He remembers when he first met Poppo. The old man hires him after witnessing the teenage Tony kill another kid. Back in the present, Tony taunts Poppo who assures Tony he will be brutally tortured. Tony, unrepentant, allows his mind to drift into the future, dwelling on the beauty of young Jasmine and the dark loneliness of the aged Poppy, just before returning to where he was at the story’s beginning, dead and buried in the concrete tomb of Potsdamer Platz.
